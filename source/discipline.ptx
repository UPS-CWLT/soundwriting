    <title>Discipline-Specific Writing</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>In the previous chapters, we have discussed general traits of all (or most?) academic writing and all academic writing processes. But, as you will no doubt notice, there are some significant differences between writing in different disciplines. It may sometimes seem like faculty members just want you to keep changing your writing to fit their individual preferences. While we all have our own preferences, faculty members also are trained specialists within their own disciplinary backgrounds, and part of their job is to teach you about those disciplinary backgrounds<mdash/>including the writing conventions of those disciplines.</p>
        <p>To help you navigate the discipline-specific writing conventions you encounter in your courses, we have consulted with faculty in departments at the University of Puget Sound. Based on our conversations with them, we have compiled the following guidelines. Try using these guidelines when you write your next paper; you may find that that seemingly quirky assignment makes more sense than you initially thought!</p>
        <p>While this chapter emphasizes many skills that are specific to writing in different disciplines, don’t despair at the impossibility of learning them all! Writing skills developed in one class will also be useful in other courses and disciplines, especially between similar disciplines like Biology and Chemistry or like English and Art History. <em>Transfer</em> refers to the application of academic skills developed in one context to another context. While a literary analysis paper and a research paper are very different, a student might apply skills like argumentation and evidence incorporation that they learned in one of these contexts to the other. This requires a conscious or unconscious understanding of the similarities and differences between the two contexts. For example, how does the contextual framing of a lab report in chemistry differ from biology? How is it similar? Understanding these expectations explicitly will help you successfully transfer writing skills across the disciplines--and into the writing you will do in your life beyond college. <xref ref="writing-lab-reports"/> addresses transfer between scientific disciplines for writing lab reports. </p>

        <title>Writing for African American Studies</title>
        <p>African American Studies (<init>AFAM</init>) is a discipline that you probably didn't encounter in high school, and hopefully you're excited about how much you have to learn. Read this guide to understand the basics of writing in <init>AFAM</init>!</p>
        <note>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, all italicized quotes throughout this section are excerpted from the interview with <init>AFAM</init> faculty members at the University of Puget Sound that informed this section.</p>
        </note>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p><q><em>Without writing it's hard for students to even learn and process what they're getting from AFAM, because it's so much, but if you start to write it, you can really start to gather your thoughts—what you do know, what you don't know, rather than just being able to shake your head agree, or even give a couple comments randomly in class. When you're trying to put it on paper you see the fact that, most likely it's a lot bigger than you thought.</em></q></p>
            <p>Distinct from other disciplines, AFAM is a deeply introspective, interdisciplinary, civically engaged and explicitly ethical field. Accordingly, the purpose of <init>AFAM</init> is to shape and strengthen your ethical convictions through informed research and writing. Thus, writing in AFAM is a practice that intentionally gives you a space to reflect more deeply on the bigger pictures of the discipline—to see what you didn't see before, to see your mind out loud. Therefore, even as AFAM shapes you into a better writer, it can also reveal to you how you've been taught to think by society and other disciplines, and encourage you to reflect on those teachings. This introspective quality of AFAM makes it uniquely interdisciplinary, allowing it to take on the absences, the unaddressed issues and unanswered questions of other disciplines. Lastly, AFAM will also push you outside yourself and into the experiences of others and into the civic sphere that the discipline itself is engaged in.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Traits and Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>You have to ask <sq>where we should have been in history?</sq> Because people of color are missing, that's why we cover all the disciplines, to ask <sq>where are we?</sq> So, really, every discipline is a part of Black Studies.</em></q></p>
            <p>At the heart of <init>AFAM</init> is an interdisciplinary formation. At its beginnings AFAM took on the absences of all the other disciplines, the places in them where should people of color have been. Accordingly, <init>AFAM</init> asks you to write conscious of the other disciplines you're writing in, not by being obedient to those disciplines, but by being aware that all disciplines have particular modes and methods of thinking and that they understand evidence differently—in a way that isn't necessarily objective. For instance, if you're citing an anthropologist on a particular topic, part of your analysis needs to include context like <q>What does an anthropologist tend to see and not see?</q> and <q>What is it that the field says?</q></p>
            <p>Another of <init>AFAM</init>'s values is the importance of understanding both sides of an argument and where both sides are coming from. It's an ethic of respect and regard to ask, before you get to <q>I disagree</q> and <q>I'm arguing this,</q> whether you know what the actual argument you're opposing is. This ethic of respect also extends backwards within the field itself: ideas have a long trajectory, and we tend to quote only the recent works. For example, we tend to give the prison industrial complex and the new Jim Crow conversations to Michelle Alexander, and that affects the erasure of Angela Davis. So when you're building an argument, you have to ask where the idea came from, because that's part of the battle against erasure. Further, this battle is an intersectional one, within the field, across gender, sexuality and class. Even within Black Studies there are ways in which certain writings get privileged and others don't, so the writing in this field strives not to practice the same erasure that other fields have practiced.</p>
            <p>A third characteristic of writing in <init>AFAM</init> is its civic engagement. Scholarship in AFAM is meant to reach out beyond practitioners of the field to people who aren't necessarily trained in sociology or history: if someone were to pick up your paper anywhere, they should be able to know what it's about quickly and efficiently. Although your professor likely already knows or has explained in class the definitions and the context of what you're writing about, at the end of the day, a lot of people don't know, and that's who you're writing to. Consequently, you have to make sure there's a foundation within your own writing that sets up for what you're sharing. You always have that platform you kick off of.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p><q><em>The idea that knowledge can come from outside of the academy is really central to Black Feminist thought.</em></q></p>
            <p>Unlike in many other disciplines, the lived experience and identity of the author are very important in <init>AFAM</init>. It would be difficult, in this field, to dismiss the personal because <init>AFAM</init> doesn’t exist without questioning knowledge production, without noting that knowledge is <em>not</em> objective and that Eurocentric disciplinary knowledge comes out of a particular time and place. So acknowledgment of personal perspectives or identity or position is a part of how this field understands knowledge constructions. Indeed, <init>AFAM</init> literally began with personal experience, with slave narratives. Some of our first historical information about Black folks is from those stories, and it’s in them that we first start to get a glimpse of what society was like for African Americans and other marginalized groups. Those narratives, written from an African American perspective, are the only way that some original truth or experience can be found. Even if you’re not African American or Black and you’re in this field, you still can’t erase the personal because that identity situates you.</p>
            <p>You do have to be careful with personal experience, though. Any evidence you bring forward must be part of a larger conversation, not something that only relates to you.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Conventions and Tips</title>
            <p><q><em>It’s not about political correctness or censorship. It’s care. Historically situated care. It’s not that you didn’t use the politically correct thing, it’s that you didn’t use the contextually careful thing, the ethically careful thing. The only way to write ethically is to practice.</em></q></p>
            <p><ul>
                <li><p>Language is important. Be very specific about the language you use throughout your writing; here are a couple of specific guidelines:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Capitalize <q>African American Studies,</q> and it's singular not plural.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Use current, appropriate language in your writing. Language used in the past to identify people of color is usually not appropriate in the current context unless you are citing a quote. (see <xref ref="writing-with-awareness"/> for more help on this, and if you’re still not sure, ask your professor).</p></li>
                    </ul></p></li>
                <li><p>Understand and convey the situatedness of whatever you write about. For instance, if you're writing about DuBois, you've got to explain why DuBois was arguing the way he was (in opposition to Booker T. Washington).</p></li>
                <li><p>Integrating language and quotes from Non-<init>SAE</init> speakers is encouraged. Use your writing as a space to include different voices. For instance, in an upper level <init>AFAM</init> class you might write a scientific counseling article about drug addiction but you could have direct excerpts about people's experiences with drug addiction as African Americans related to whatever section you’re talking about because that adds to it (see <xref ref="SAE"/>).</p></li>
                <li><p>Define your terms! You can't assume that everybody knows what you mean. Also sometimes there are many words for the same definition. You need to explain that when you say <q>Black,</q> you mean this vs. when you say <q>African American</q> you mean that.</p></li>
                <li><p>Don't rely on jargon! Your writing should be a way you can express what you're learning in class to the public. Jargon can get in the way.</p></li>
                <li><p>Come to class and do the reading so that you're prepared to write respectfully.</p></li>
            </ul></p>

        <title>Writing for Art and Art History</title>
        <p>Writing about art can be challenging because, before embarking on a discussion or analysis of a work, you first have to translate your experience of a visual image or a structure into language.  This is true not only for Art History students whose papers are often based on the visual analysis of images or monuments, but also for Studio Art students who write artist statements in which they verbally articulate ideas and influences that they have expressed visually in their work.</p>
        <note>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, all italicized quotes throughout this section are excerpted from the interview with Art and Art History faculty members at the University of Puget Sound that informed this section.</p>
        </note>
        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-art-genres">
            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>The most frequent types of papers students write in Art History courses include visual analysis papers, research papers, critical analyses of scholarly articles, and exhibition reviews.  While research papers and critical analyses of scholarly articles are similar to such papers in other disciplines (<eg/>, History or English), they likely include a visual analysis component that is not typical in other disciplines.  Visual analysis papers and exhibition reviews are genres unique to Art History and Art Criticism, and they both build on the close reading of a single object/monument or a close reading of a series objects and the space in which they are displayed.  Studio Art students frequently write exhibition reviews or responses, analyses of the work of an influential artist, and artist statements.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-art-purpose">
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p>The purpose of writing in Art and Art History courses is to derive meaning from visual works from the past and present, to become more skilled in visual literacy, and to develop and amplify skills of analysis and argumentation, and independent thinking.  Art and Art History papers will also develop your self-expression and facilitate your immersion in the creative field of Art or the scholarly field of Art History based upon sound research skills and careful, solid arguments.  Studio Art courses will prompt you to reflect carefully on your own artistic processes and ways of thinking and to articulate your relationship to the tradition of art-making.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-art-characteristics">
            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p>A unique characteristic of writing in Art History is its reliance on visual analysis. The ultimate goal of writing a visual analysis is to understand how the work you're writing about conveyed and conveys meaning.  A convincing visual analysis is an interpretation of the work that combines the examination of formal, experiential details in light of relevant contextual information, therefore close reading of visual information and the critical analysis of primary and secondary sources are valued characteristics of art historical writing.</p>
            <p>For visual analysis papers and exhibition reviews, the first step is translating your experience of what you see and what you feel or perceive with your senses into words; for example, when you stand in front of Michelangelo's <pubtitle>David</pubtitle> at the Gallery of the Academy in Florence, you not only look at the composition and carefully crafted details of the sculpture, you also react to its size, its placement on a high pedestal, your opportunity to walk around the figure, and the space where it is displayed and other visitors' reactions to it. When you are not able to visit the work in person, you should still try to imagine how it operates in its physical context, taking into account whether it is currently found in its original location.  Once you have performed this first, observational step, the second step in visual analysis is to contextualize the artwork you're writing about in its historical moment.  One way to contextualize an artwork is to compare it to works of art that have a similar subject matter, share its time period, or both. This kind of comparison will help you and your reader understand how the work fits into larger artistic developments. Another way to contextualize an artwork is to understand its social, religious, or cultural role by using primary textual sources (<eg/>, diaries of artists or patrons involved, documents of the work's commissioning, preparatory sketches or studies of the artist, newspaper articles that reveal how the work was received when it was first displayed, and historical accounts that describe the work). A third way to contextualize an artwork is to understand how it was originally displayed. A final contextualization strategy is to use the work of scholars who have studied the same monument or related monument to build on or refute.</p>
            <p>A common genre in Studio Art is an artist statement. The valued characteristics in an artist statement differ somewhat from those in a visual analysis. An artist statement is a short essay, about one page in length that is written in the first person. The purpose of artist statements is to articulate the processes, influences, and concepts that inform your independent artistic practices. These statements verbalize the multi-faceted ideas that inform artists' work, providing helpful context for viewers, curators, selection panels, and peers.  A compelling artist statement communicates significant elements about the motives and concerns that inspire works of art.  It can address a number of meaningful issues and influences such as your sense of identity, intellectual or technical aspects of your artistic process, and your position in relation to the history of your medium.  An artist statement is subjective in the sense that it reflects personal creative processes, yet it should also reflect and even interrogate broader cultural, social, political, and/or scientific themes.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-art-evidence">
            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p>For Art History papers, your evidence will be drawn from three types of sources: the visual evidence provided by the work of art that you are analyzing; primary textual sources that date to the same period as your visual evidence; and scholarly secondary sources.  Secondary scholarly sources can provide you with a framework for analysis, or can provide factual information about primary sources that the author used but you may not have easy access to. Secondary sources can also offer an interpretation of the work you are analyzing which you may accept or reject based on your own critical analysis of the work, primary sources, and the scholarly literature. You will need to document the sources of your ideas and information vigorously throughout your paper in order to show what sources you have used for your work; art historians typically use footnotes or endnotes for such purpose.</p>
            <p>Papers that you will write in Studio Art courses will focus primarily on visual evidence, although occasionally primary sources of artists' writings or secondary scholarly sources will also be used.</p>

            <p><ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Be selective. When you are writing a visual analysis, keep in mind that you will not be able to describe every detail of the work, so you will need to select the most dominant features that convey the meaning of the work. In organizing a visual analysis, always provide a brief description of the work as a whole before examining specific details of it more fully.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Be descriptive and analytical. When you describe visual features of an artwork in your visual analysis, explain why those aspects of the work contribute to the overall meaning conveyed by the work. Describing a visual feature of an artwork is similar to using quotes in other disciplines, such as History or English.  Just as you do not throw a quote from a primary or secondary source into your text without explaining its importance, do not let the visual evidence speak for itself, since a different viewer might draw different conclusions than what you are getting at.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use Chicago Style to format your citations in Art History papers (see <xref ref="citations"/>).</p>

        <title>Writing for Biology</title>
        <p>Some students initially believe that writing is not important to science; however, lab reports are actually vital to understanding the context and the relevance of the science you are doing in lab and learning about in class, and their format allows scientists to communicate findings concisely and succinctly. After learning the specific skills that are needed, many students learn that they particularly enjoy writing for the natural sciences. Read this guide to learn about how writing for biology can be helpful and meaningful to you!</p>

            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>As in most science classes, the vast majority of the writing you do will be in the form of lab reports. Lab reports are papers based on an investigation that follows the standard template of an introduction, a methods section, a presentation of results, and a discussion of those results. In most biology classes you will be asked to write both full-length lab reports as well as individual sections of one for practice. Other kinds of writing that you may be asked to do include abstracts, critical reviews (in which you synthesize the primary literature on a topic) or, in upper-division classes, research proposals, and research papers.</p>

            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p><q><em>We spend so much time in lab on the methods portion and results portion, but lab reports are really helpful because they make us put our results in the greater context.</em></q></p>
            <p>It's entirely too easy to become myopic in lab (both figuratively and literally<mdash/>goggles don't help anyone's eyesight). Because of this possibility, lab reports become not only effective ways to communicate the results of an experiment to other scientists, but also good places to help you understand the science you have done more fully and in the context of biology as a discipline. Further, while the prescribed format may seem constraining, there is a reason why it has lasted: it can help you organize your own thoughts and give you the space to <q>step back</q> and find the larger frame for your experiment. In this way, lab reports are actually great opportunities to rethink what you've done in lab and learned in class on your own and to understand the larger import of the experiment you conducted.</p>

        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-biology-characteristics">
            <title>Traits and Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>I like to think of science almost like a coral reef you can build on: you build on what's beneath.</em></q></p>
            <p>The purpose of doing an experiment is never just to have done the experiment; rather, as the quote marking this subsection indicates, the purpose of a lab is not to repeat something already known but to build innovatively on what you've learned, allowing you to explore the emergent properties of scientific knowledge. This idea is particularly important to remember when you're writing for biology because writing in biology requires that you frame any experimental description with the <q>why</q> behind your research.</p>
            <p>Further, because biology is a natural science, it adheres to the principles of the scientific method, requiring objectivity, reproducibility, and quantitative results. For these reasons it's important to communicate clearly and efficiently in a style that reflects this objectivity and relies on quantitative values rather than vague words like <q>more</q> or <q>greater.</q></p>
            <p>While there is a convention-driven style to a lot of science writing in which you follow established norms, a good scientist thinks creatively about the field, where the gaps are, and where they can contribute. In this way, there is always room within the individual sections and their connecting links to explain ideas in an innovative way, ask creative questions, and propose new ideas for future research.</p>

            <p>Because biology is a natural science, the only kind of data you should use is empirical, reproducible data you have collected yourself or data from a peer-reviewed, secondary source published in a scholarly journal.

                <li><p>Rely on the formatting given to you by your professors.

            <p>The typical genres you'll be writing in for business are short memos<mdash/>in which you will brief your audience with the relevant and pressing facts of a situation<mdash/>and case studies, which consist of three parts: an introduction, in which you will provide appropriate historical and contextual information about a business or company; a strategic analysis section, in which you will identify and analyze structural and organizational problems with that business or company; and a final section, in which you will recommend solutions for those problems. Other typical genres include position papers, in which you will present a disputable issue from one side; research papers, for which you will research a topic and present that research to support a thesis; literature reviews, in which you will summarize and analyze secondary sources relevant to a specific topic; and personal reflections.</p>

            <p><q><em>Writing is used in decision-making.</em></q></p>
            <p>The purpose of writing for business classes isn't exactly the same as the purpose of writing in the professional business world: classes are specifically designed for you to practice and improve your writing skills, whereas the professional world is often more results oriented. For this reason, academic papers are generally more focused and less broad than professional ones so that you will have enough time to do a thorough job. Despite the difference between class and the professional world, you should treat the business essays you write as though they were directed at a real professional audience. Accordingly, because your imagined audience is made up of practicing professionals, it's important to remember that, whereas in most other disciplines you are only trying to persuade someone to <em>believe</em> something, in business you are trying to persuade someone to believe something <em>so that they will do something</em>. You can think of your writing as a tool you can use to have a direct impact on a person's, company's, or government's actions.</p>

            <p><q><em>Don't make your reader do the work. You need to do all the work.</em></q></p>
            <p>Writing for business should be as direct, simple, concise, and accurate as possible<mdash/>don't use too many adjectives or try to sound poetic. Although this spare style of writing may feel impersonal, there are very important reasons to use it. The writing done for business in the professional world is used directly in decision-making. In consequence, the conventions of business writing are oriented toward informing your readers so that they can make their decisions as accurately and efficiently as possible. By being direct and simple, you allow your audience to understand the situation and ideas you are describing while simultaneously making it clear to that audience that you understand the situation and are a competent source. By being concise, you show that you are efficient and that you value your readers' time, and by being accurate you show your reader that you are willing to be honest and realistic.</p>
            <p>Further, within these guidelines there is room to be creative: an important part of business writing is innovation. In the last part of many business papers (such as case studies) you will be asked to suggest possible solutions to the problem or question you've outlined in the body of your paper. This is a place in your writing where you get to think innovatively about the possible futures and outcomes of various choices, and present your ideas about how best to implement strategies to ensure the best possible future. In this part of your writing it's particularly important to be value neutral: these possible solutions are not about what a person <em>should</em> do; these possible solutions are about what a person or company <em>can</em> do.</p>

            <p>When you're providing evidence in a business paper, the kinds of evidence you'll want to rely on will come largely from peer-reviewed publications. In business scenarios, quantifiable evidence is usually the most persuasive, so using figures and situating data in its dated time period are key to building a reliable, accurate argument.</p>

            <p><ul>
                <li><p>Proofread your paper for spelling and grammar. While grammar may seem less important to some writers, imagine that you are a business executive sending an email to your staff. If the email you send has spelling errors in the first sentence you could lose credibility and professionalism in the eyes of your readers.</p></li>
                <li><p>You can use subheadings to organize your papers. While subheadings are discouraged in some disciplines, feel free to use them for business papers to add extra clarity and formality.</p></li>
                <li><p>Don't use clichés, contractions, or passive clauses. And while personal pronouns are okay, don't start a sentence with <q>I think.</q> While these rules may seem overly fastidious, it's important to follow them so that your writing is both professional and reflective of your own distinctive voice. Using clichés is counterproductive to both of these values because they aren't your own words and they are not particularly professional. Further, starting a sentence with <q>I think</q> can sound demure rather than convincing. And finally, using passive clauses rather than active ones can sometimes emphasize the responsibility or actions of the subject of a sentence. Write actively to ensure that your prose is fluid and compelling.</p></li>

        <title>Writing for Chemistry</title>
        <p>Writing can sometimes seem like an obstacle for science students. Within scientific culture, the importance of effective communication is often underemphasized. This under emphasis leads many students entering college to see science writing as, at best, a necessary evil, and at worst, a tangled mess of jargon and arbitrary formatting. So far from being true, the exact opposite is the case. In the wise words of <custom ref="chemistry-professor"/>, <q>Science is in the communication. Science doesn't exist in someone's head. The science <em>is</em> the communication.</q> To learn more about how to be an effective science writer, read this guide!</p>

            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>Writing in chemistry is challenging for new students since there are many different types of writing in chemistry. However, most of these genres can be broken down into a shared set of sections, each with its own distinctive style and purpose: a title, an abstract, an introduction, an experimental section, a results section, a discussion, a conclusion, and a literature cited. Together, these sections make up the most fundamental genre in chemistry writing: research articles (<ie/>, lab reports). Further, these sections also make up the research posters, review articles, and research proposals you'll be introduced to in upper-level classes. The only kind of writing in chemistry not made up by these sections is the notes you'll take in your laboratory notebook.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-chemistry-purpose">
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p>The purpose of chemistry writing depends on the genre. A lab notebook is meant to be fairly informal, but clear and detailed enough that another chemist unfamiliar with the experiment you're doing could open up your notebook and repeat the experiment. Keeping this kind of detailed record of your lab work will allow you to go back later and understand what it was you did in lab. In turn, understanding what you did will give you the context you need to write an informed lab report and thus make the process much easier.</p>
            <p>These lab reports are formal papers that are meant to be places for you to practice sorting through, presenting and analyzing data. Further, lab reports also give you practice deepening your understanding of what you did in lab by allowing you to see your knowledge gaps and fill them by looking things up or asking your classmates and professor. Last but not least, lab reports are the avenues of communicating your results to faculty and other scientists, making them the crucial places where science really occurs.</p>

            <p><q><em>Brevity may be the soul of wit, but it is the cerebrum of good science writing.</em></q></p>
            <p>When you write for chemistry, be clear, concise, and precise. In art, ambiguity is often ripe with meaning, but in scientific writing ambiguity is distracting. One of the most common writing errors chemistry students make is being vague when they should be precise. Don't say <q>the product was obtained in good yield</q> when you could just as easily say <q>the aldehyde 3 was obtained in 64% yield,</q> a statement that contains much more useful information for other scientists trying to replicate your experiment.</p>
            <p>Despite the importance of clarity, being precise shouldn't prevent you from telling a story with your data: structuring a lab report as a narrative is a higher-level skill that can turn a seemingly mundane paper into a compelling one. Your Title provides a hook to draw in the reader; then the Introduction sets the narrative background and poses the problem that needs solving; the Experimental and Results sections show how your protagonist has interrogated nature, and the answers they have gained; and then the Discussion puts the results in context with other results cited in the Intro (by either verifying or contesting them) while forcing you to explain why this might be. Of course there are often questions left unanswered, or new questions that arose in the course of the work; these then appear at the end of the Discussion to entice the reader to look for the sequel (that is, the reader's own subsequent research).</p>

            <p><q><em>A figure saves a thousand words.</em></q></p>
            <p>Evidence in chemistry<mdash/>as in all natural sciences<mdash/>is exclusively empirical, reproducible data from experiments you have done yourself or from a peer-reviewed, scholarly source. As the quote marking this subsection suggests, it can be very helpful to organize your results and explain the context you give in your introduction using figures and tables. These tables and figures are a powerful way to harness your evidence if you pair them with descriptive captions and embed them in the text of your lab report. That said, figures and tables don't <em>replace</em> words: don't include a figure if you don't explain it in text!</p>

            <title>Conventions and Tips</title>
            <p><ul>
                <li><p>Don't write from beginning to end. Many students think they should write a report in the order that it appears, but this is often an inefficient way to write a research paper<mdash/>the abstract comes immediately after the title, but it should normally be written last, because it is easier to summarize the research after you've written the entire report and have thus refined your understanding of the research. Although there is no one-size-fits-all approach, here is an order that is usually effective: Organize your thoughts and your data, write the Experimental Section, prepare the important illustrations (<ie/>, Tables, Figures, and Schemes), write the Results section (using the illustrations as a guide), draft an outline of the Discussion section, write the Introduction, complete the Discussion Section, write the Conclusions, add References, write the Title and Abstract.</p></li>
                <li><p>Start early and get help if needed. Usually professors won't have time to go over your whole draft, so make sure you go into office hours or send an email with a few specific questions for them to answer.</p></li>
                <li><p>Know your audience. You are writing for other chemists with a similar level of knowledge to your own but who are not familiar with the exact experiments you performed. You don't have to go into gory detail about procedures that any chemist should know<mdash/>it is even OK to use a little jargon if it is part of the chemist's lexicon. For example, <q>the reaction was heated at reflux for 2 hours</q> is perfectly clear to any chemist who has taken organic chemistry.</p></li>
                <li><p>Delete superfluous words: don't say <q>the melting point <em>was determined to be</em> 198-199ºC,</q> say <q>the melting point <em>is</em> 198-199ºC.</q></p></li>
                <li><p>Chemical names are not capitalized (unless they are trade names).</p></li>
                <li><p>All manuscripts should be double-spaced (unless told otherwise).</p></li>
                <li><p>Use the proper number of significant figures when reporting data.</p></li>
                <li><p>Always put a space between a number and its units.</p></li>
                <li><p>Always put a zero in front of a decimal value, otherwise a decimal can be mistaken for a period.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use the correct citation style (see <xref ref="citations"/>).</p></li>

        <introduction>
            <p>While it may seem like Computer Science (<init>CS</init>) has very little to do with writing, strong written communication skills will help you succeed and stand out in this field. Writing code is a fundamental skill in <init>CS</init>, and while it’s different than any other form of writing it still requires organization and clarity. Other writing in <init>CS</init> includes commenting code to give it longevity and utility to other coders, and academic papers to share your work with other computer scientists. Read this section to learn some strategies for effective writing in computer science classes! Writing for <init>CS</init> classes generally takes two forms: Code and code comments, and formal academic papers. Because these two genres are so different, this chapter is split into a section for each. Other writing takes the form of less formal responses and short assignments. These will vary considerably and your professor’s instructions will provide the best guidelines.</p>

            <title>Writing Code and Code Comments</title>
            <note>

            <paragraphs>
                <title>Purpose</title>
                <p>Coding is the meat of computer science, and comments are critical for communicating what your code does to other users. Though comments are usually short and don’t always contain full sentences, they never-the-less require clear communication of the most important ideas. Comments generally fall into two categories: informal and formal. Informal comments are notes sprinkled throughout the code that annotate the algorithm to make it clearer for anyone who needs to work with it (including your future self!). Because computer code can be incredibly tedious to understand, and because two people will write different algorithms to accomplish the same goal, the purpose of these comments is to make your code more human-readable and to communicate the main ideas and steps in your code, as you would if outlining an essay. Informal comments do not need to follow an official style guide. In fact, they don’t even have to be complete sentences, but they should be clear and easy to understand. Formal comments (such as Javadoc comments in the Java language) explain the functionality and any inputs (parameters) and outputs (returns) of your methods, fields, and classes. They must follow a specific format so that they can be used to generate a webpage outlining the functionality of the code and giving instructions to use it. To write formal comments, carefully follow your professor’s directions and/or provided style guides. Good comments, both informal and formal, should not state obvious parts of your code, such as that you are using a loop; they should convey what the code does, but not unnecessary details about how it does it.</p>

                    <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
                    <p><q><em>All of the writing I give to my students is an attempt to have them practice the skills they will be doing when they are professionals.</em></q></p>
                    <p>Concise and precise writing are vital for good comments. The comment should include everything someone might need to use the code successfully, but nothing they can tell just from looking at it. One comment for every 4<ndash/>5 lines of code is generally a good amount, but it can vary depending on the complexity of your work. Comments should tell the user <em>what</em> the code does, but not all of the details of <em>how</em> it does it.</p>
                    <p>When writing code, efficiency is also highly valued. This doesn’t mean that the shortest code is best, but code that makes the computer do less work, use less space, and run faster (e.g., has smaller <term>time complexity</term> and <term>space complexity</term>) is valued professionally, where the efficiency of your code can cost or save money and impact customer satisfaction. As you code, think about ways to eliminate redundant code and use less computer memory. In the earlier days of computing, when memory was expensive, writing compact code was an important skill. However, in modern times the professional value of human readable and intuitive code is much higher.</p>

                    <title>Conventions and Tips</title>
                    <p><ul>
                        <li><p>Exact formatting, down to use of punctuation and white space, is critical in formal commenting and coding because a computer needs to be able to generate a documentation website from what you write. <em>Read and use style guides to make sure your comments are properly formatted!</em></p></li>
                        <li><p>The number of informal comments you should have throughout your code varies with the complexity of the code you are annotating and the language you are writing in. When writing in Java, a higher-level (more human-readable) language, you can expect to comment on average every 4<ndash/>5 lines. However, when writing assembly code, which is much lower-level (and consequently difficult to read), it is standard to comment every line of code.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Many <init>CS</init> classes involve pair or group programming. When working with others, be sure to set yourself up to share the work equally. Choose a workspace where everyone is involved and pass the computer back and forth between logical units. Be self aware about the amount and ways you contribute, and give your partner space to contribute. Be open-minded and curious about what your partner has to add to the project.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Write your comments as you write your code, even if you need to go back and alter them later, rather than hurriedly adding them right before turning in your assignment. As you write longer and more complicated code and work as part of a team of programmers, it will be increasingly difficult to remember what your idea was when writing old code, and your colleagues will need to stay updated on your code as you write it because their code may depend on your implementation.</p></li>

                    <p>Code is a form of writing, and, even when programming a simple task, one person’s code differs from another’s in the same way essays differ. While tons of code is available online (such as on Stack Overflow) and sharing code is useful in more advanced projects, copying someone’s code without crediting them <em>is plagiarism</em> (see <xref ref="plagiarism"/>). If you are unsure about whether you can use code you found online or elsewhere, always ask your professor.</p>

                                <p>The purpose of <init>CS</init> papers, like in other sciences, is to contribute to academic knowledge in the field and share your work. The audience is other computer scientists, though not necessarily in your specific subsection of the field. A paper shares new ideas or contributions, so that others can learn from them and potentially build on your work. While student papers may or may not actually be presented at a conference, they are practice for this type of academic work and should be written with the same goals in mind.</p>

At no point do you let go with both hands. In the same way you are carrying your reader from one sentence to the next to the next and you can't let them go.</em></q></p>
                                <p>In academic papers, computer scientists must be able to convey complex ideas with enough detail and clarity that their colleagues can understand them. Therefore, it’s vital for the writer be able to break down complicated ideas into precise, logical steps. This is sometimes referred to as <term>algorithmic thinking</term>. For example, think about the level of clarity that would be required to teach a child to perform a task like tying their shoes... over the phone. Your writing should walk the reader through every step, never making logical jumps that might leave them behind. It should start at the beginning and introduce all the important terms and notation before you use them.</p>
                                <p>Concise writing is also valued in <init>CS</init>. While you should include anything the reader will need to understand, avoid unnecessarily fancy words or sentence structures. The ideas are complex and difficult to understand, but your writing should not be. <q>Untwist</q> your sentences, clearly linking nouns and verbs and avoiding dangling phrases. Likewise, precision in language (see <xref ref="style-writing-clearly"/>) is very important. Avoid vague phrases or sweeping claims. Instead, use language that conveys your ideas as exactly as possible without going beyond the scope of your work. The main challenge is including all the necessary information, but nothing extra.</p>

When using evidence from others, also be sure to explain how it relates to your topic and to cite it properly.

        <title>Writing for English</title>
        <p>Many students entering college think they know what writing for an English class should be like: While most students haven't taken a psychology or Science, Technology, and Society class, the majority of students have taken several English classes before college and have prior experience writing English papers. Depending on their experiences, students may believe that English writing is congenitally imprecise and emotional because it is founded on subjective opinions rather than facts because <q>there are no right answers.</q> Alternately, students may think that English papers are brittle five-paragraph essays that impoverish the texts that they analyze. While these assumptions can be hard to displace, English essays are neither unsubstantiated opinions nor life-sucking exercises in pedantry. Rather, English essays can be powerful transformations of your impressions and emotions of a text into a substantiated analysis that reveals the more profound underpinnings of that text. Read this guide to get an idea of how to get the most out of writing for English!</p>

            <p><q><em>Close reading is the meat and potatoes<mdash/>or the tofu and seitan<mdash/>of what we do.</em></q></p>
            <p>Although you'll be asked to write in scads of different genres for your English classes, close readings are the foundation on which all English writing rests. Close readings are essentially papers that ask you to move beyond saying <em>that</em> something exists in a text (for instance, alliteration), to <em>how</em> it's used: That is, what it suggests in relation to other elements of the text, and why that realization matters. Longer papers in English classes can take the form of open-ended research papers, or analysis of the relationships between a text and its historical moment; however, these longer papers are built upon extended close readings for which you will have developed a theoretical framework. Other genres in English include many kinds of creative writing, such as personal essays, memoirs, and poetry, as well as book reviews or letters. You may be asked to write in these creative genres in traditional English classes as well as creative writing English classes.</p>

            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p><q><em>We are not teaching, for the most part, content, as much as we're teaching habits of mind and skills. <ellipsis/> We are asking students to become practitioners of the genres and the forms that we ourselves work in.</em></q></p>
            <p>The purpose of writing in English classes is to become a better writer and a better reader. In your English classes your professors don't want you to put on an analytic production just for the professor's eyes; rather, you are being asked to take a step in a larger series of conversations that will allow you to practice habits of mind and transferable analytical skills. Hopefully these habits of mind will include a deeper appreciation for the profound and subtle ways language shapes our imagined realities, as well as how our own theoretical biases affect how we read a text.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-english-characteristics">
            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>Show me that I'm progressing. <ellipsis/> I want to feel like I'm learning with the paper.</em></q></p>
            <p>Writing for English, perhaps more so than any other discipline, emphasizes the process or craft of an essay rather than the product. This emphasis is inherent to the discipline because English is so consummately qualitative: you are not presenting quantitative data or known observations and conclusions. Rather you are making a qualitative analysis that puts your data (your textual observations) into a meaningful pattern and then commenting on the overall meaning or effect of that pattern. In this way, the form of an English essay is just as important as its content: <em>how</em> you have organized your ideas and presented them is just as important as the ideas themselves. For this reason English papers should not be like lists of evidence; rather, they should show the development of an argument over the course of an essay, with each paragraph advancing the argument.</p>
            <p>Because the writer's process of thought is so important to the English essay, your professors will tell you that good reading is the beginning of good writing and that the process of good reading is itself good thinking: how you read will be reflected in how you write<mdash/>meaning that to be able to write well you yourself must think critically, take notes, and make observations while you read instead of merely absorbing the words on the page.</p>
            <p>One aspect of English essays that can be a stumbling block to students is also the thing that can make it so rewarding: Far from having a single correct answer, texts have a multitude of possible solutions and interpretations. Because there is no absolute, definitive interpretation, many students can be caught in the difference between opinions and arguments: sometimes it can feel unnerving to make an interpretive leap because you think that it isn't 100% certain<mdash/>but that's actually the nature of the claims we make as English writers: while they are substantiated, they are fundamentally arguable. An arguable claim is different from an opinion in that arguments are substantiated by textual evidence while opinions are not.</p>

            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p><q><em>Evidence is two parts: textual evidence (quotes and paraphrases) and analysis.</em></q></p>
            <p>Evidence in English is almost exclusively textual; however, textual evidence is not <q>evidence</q> in itself! When you include textual evidence it should be because its specific language or mechanical aspects are <q>meaningful in a way that is irreducible</q>; that is, it would be impossible to rephrase the language in any other way without losing some important part of the meaning. However the meaning that <em>you</em> see in the textual evidence is not self-evident: when you include textual evidence you must always use your own words to explain how it is meaningful to your argument.</p>

            <title>Conventions and Tips</title>
            <p><ul>
                <li><p>When you get an essay back, carefully consider the comments your professor has made. Professors put a lot of time and thought into writing them. These comments are a great way not only to improve your writing but also serve as the beginning of a conversation you can have with your professor during office hours.</p></li>
                <li><p>Although English writing has a reputation for being florid and ornate, as in every other discipline, good writing is clear writing. Don't use as many adverbs as possible or sacrifice clarity and coherence for an elevated register.</p></li>
                <li><p>Make sure you're telling your reader exactly what you want them to think. Don't make your reader intuit your argument.</p></li>
                <li><p>If you don't know something, look it up! Answering your own questions is part of the writing process. You have the vast power of the Internet at your fingertips! If you're having trouble doing this on your own, schedule a writing appointment or get in touch with a librarian!</p></li>
                <li><p>You can get better with each assignment, but you're not going to become a top-tier English scholar in one assignment, or even one semester. Don't get discouraged! Focus on getting better.</p></li>
                <li><p>A thesis can be more than one sentence! And it doesn't have to be at the end of the first paragraph.</p></li>
                <li><p>You can use the first person, but use it carefully. Use <em>I</em> when you need to acknowledge that your view diverges from others' views or when you need to be clear about some aspect of your methods which you personally did (<em>One</em> did not review a year's worth of newspapers; <em>I</em> did).</p></li>
                <li><p>Don't hide behind an <em>I</em> to say that it's just little old me who thinks something, but that it's probably not right; however, some hedging is good! You don't have to <q>prove</q> something beyond a shadow of a doubt; you can be circumspect and use words like <q>suggests</q> or <q>indicates</q> to acknowledge where the evidence isn't strong enough to make a bolder claim.</p></li>
                <li><p>Introduce the authors of your secondary sources in text. This helps establish context and shows that you are entering into a conversation with other scholars.</p></li>

            <title>Writing for Exercise Science</title>
                <introduction>
                    <p>Students in Exercise Science, like other STEM students, must learn to write well in order to communicate scientific ideas both to other scientists and to general audiences. Writing assignments in Exercise Science classes build on the foundational scientific writing skills developed in introductory biology and chemistry to prepare students for careers in research or health professions. Strong scientific writing requires practice and attention to detail; read on for ideas on where to start.</p>
                </introduction>
                <paragraphs>
                    <title>Genres</title>
                    <p>One common genre in Exercise Science is the research paper. These are student versions of published scientific journal articles written by collaborative research teams; students sometimes write research papers as group assignments. Research papers include prescribed sections such as  Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. The best way to develop research paper writing skills is to read lots of exemplary papers from high-quality journals. Learn from the format and writing style. Some classes may also assign lab reports, which are similar to research papers but are about smaller experiments. While data presented in lab reports may not be novel, it's still important to place them in the context of the field in the introduction and conclusion.</p>
                    <p>Another type of writing assignment is a position statement. Position statements are argumentative papers where the author should give their personal stance on an issue, and support it with considerable evidence on both sides. Be sure to clearly articulate how the evidence has led you to the stance you hold.</p>
                    <p>Lay summaries of scientific journal articles are another common writing assignment. These papers help you hone your written communication skills to explain challenging scientific concepts to people from outside the field. Make sure you take time to understand the article yourself; if you don't understand it, how can you explain it? Use clear language and because the field of Exercise Science isn't a field that uses quote evidence, don't quote directly from the article.</p>
                    <p>Finally, literature reviews also require you to synthesize information from scientific literature, but for a more informed audience. Instead of summarizing a list of related papers, a lit review should show how the ideas in the papers interact with each other. As you write, group papers thematically and focus on their similarities and differences. What conclusions can you draw from the whole body of literature you examined?</p>

                    <title>Purpose</title>
                    <p><q><em>There are two big pieces to writing: one is communicating what you mean to say, and one is being right about the science.</em></q></p>
                    <p>In the field of Exercise Science, writing is used to communicate scientific discoveries and how they fit into the broader context of research in the field. As a student, you are practicing this skill: written assignments show your professor that you can synthesize published studies and/or your own data to draw conclusions about a topic. Writing can help you integrate information, demonstrate your knowledge, and communicate specialized knowledge to different audiences, including people without scientific training. By writing for different audiences, you comprehend the science better yourself and learn to communicate it in new ways.</p>

                    <title>Traits and Characteritistcs</title>
                    <p><q><em>The best way to learn how to write is to read and see how it's done.</em></q></p>
                    <p>Good writing in Exercise Science communicates difficult concepts clearly. Try to make your argument clear by explicitly laying out how point A leads to point B and point B leads to point C. If you're struggling with this, take a step back and consider what main points you're trying to convey. Use simple words where possible, and strong verbs instead of adjectives or flowery language. Concision is best: <q>Heart rate increased by 23% over 5 minutes</q> is much better than <q>This caused the heart rate to be gradually augmented by a moderate amount.</q> There's no need to confuse yourself or others by trying to sound smart! Precision of language is also important: be sure the terms you use are the correct ones, and that you define specialized jargon.</p>
                    <p>Lab reports and research papers adhere to a strict format with prescribed sections. Within sections, use paragraphs that are clearly organized around one idea and supporting evidence.  Research papers and lab reports have a concise and formal style that may be different than other forms of writing you have experienced. This consistency adheres to the expectations of readers and makes it easy for them to find information. Again, reading articles from respected Exercise Science journals is the best way to familiarize yourself with the tone and the way sentences and paragraphs are constructed.</p>

                    <paragraphs>
                        <title>Evidence</title>
                        <p>Evidence should usually be drawn from primary sources, which are peer-reviewed scientific journal articles. The <url href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed database</url>from NCBI is the best place to go for papers. When incorporating evidence, avoid direct quotations. Instead, you should read the article until you understand it well enough to clearly paraphrase the results or conclusions. Remember that paraphrased information still needs to be cited. Every statement of fact that isn't data you collected yourself should be backed up with a citation. Evidence may also include empirical data that you or your classmates collected in lab. When you report evidence from data that you collected yourself, don't just list numbers; think about the question and what data meaningfully answers it. Think about meaningful metrics like percent change or differences between experimental and control groups. In a research paper with lots of results, group results logically into paragraphs.</p>

                        <title>Conventions and Tips</title>
                        <p><ul>
                            <li><p>Get Zotero (<xref ref="zotero"/>) and learn how to use it! Exercise Science doesn't have a standard citation format, and Zotero allows you to move quickly between formats while keeping the details accurate. If you need help, see a librarian.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Pay attention to detail with your citations. Consistency is key. Even with Zotero, it's important to double- and triple-check that everything is right.</p></li>
                            <li><p>For assignments with multiple drafts, be sure to revise based on your professor's feedback. Be sure to open any feedback they've left with track changes. If the feedback is confusing, ask about it in office hours! </p></li>
                            <li><p>Pay attention to tense! If you're proposing something you haven't done, it should be in future tense. If you're reporting something you already did, like methods or results for a completed experiment, it should be in past tense. Either way, be sure to maintain consistency throughout the section. If you're unsure what tense to use, ask your professor.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Conventions on active and passive voice can differ from professor to professor, but be sure to be consistent. If you're confused about what passive voice is, check out using passive constructions cautiously (<xref ref="style-using-passive-cautiously"/>).</p></li>
                            <li><p>Take care using <q>I.</q> It may be appropriate in assignments like position papers and independent research proposals, but if you performed an experiment in a group, <q>we</q> is preferred.</p></li>

                <p>While you may imagine geologists as a bunch of dirty scientists looking at rocks through hand lenses, geology, like every science, is all about storytelling and communication. Learning to write well for your geology classes will help you succeed in the field and convey your understanding of complex concepts. Read this guide to learn the key aspects of writing in geology!</p>

                    <title>Genres</title>
                    <p>Almost all writing for geology is technical scientific writing, but the form varies in different classes and assignments. Writing in class may be single-authored or collaborative. Most geological researchers publish collaboratively these days, so take advantage of your opportunities to learn collaborative writing skills! The audience can also vary: some pieces of writing should be accessible to a broad audience, while others are written for other geologists specifically. If you aren’t sure, ask your professor. </p>
                    <p>Many assignments will ask you to engage with primary literature. Literature review papers require you to survey relevant literature on a specific topic, summarize papers, and then <em>synthesize</em> how papers interact to draw conclusions about the field. Shorter article review assignments will also require synthesis and analysis, but of just one journal article. In upper-division classes you may also write National Science Foundation-style grant proposals, where you review literature in the field and then use it to propose a novel research project.</p>
                    <p>Some writing assignments will also be sharing research that you did yourself. These could be as short as writing a results section based on a lab exercise or as long as a full journal-article-style piece about summer research. Along with grant proposals, articles disseminating new research are the most common form of writing for academic professionals in the field.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of most writing for your geology class is to convey your understanding of knowledge in the field and refine technical writing skills you’ll use as a geologist. For lab or research writing, you are also presenting new information in the context of existing literature. Using your writing to make connections with literature is critical. Professional academic geologists write to disseminate their research and put it in the context of larger inquiries in the field.</p>

                    <p>Like all scientists, geologists value clarity and concision. Work to master the skill of distilling potentially confusing concepts into words that make sense to any reader! This won’t always be easy; be sure to have others read over your work. Use headings and sections to make longer papers more approachable to the reader.</p>
                    <p>Using primary literature appropriately is very important (see next section). Make connections between the work you’re doing and the literature, or between different articles that you read. This synthesis is really important: how does literature in the field build or contradict? How have methods or core research topics changed over time? What conclusions about your topic does this lead to? Finally, remember that science is storytelling! Be sure to zoom out and connect your work to the big picture of our planet’s past and present.</p>

                    <p>Valid evidence for geology writing is usually peer-reviewed journal articles or data you collected in a lab or research project. When you cite data, it’s important that it was collected with up-to-date technology and methodology. Remember that any statement of fact you make needs to be cited! This gives credibility to your statements in addition to not being plagiarism.</p>
                    <p>Looking through the literature thoroughly is key, especially for grant proposals or lit review assignments. Search for any important original landmark papers on the topic you’re researching, even if they’re old. Then, look over all articles from the last ten years or so and all the most frequently cited articles from the last twenty years. These exact date ranges may vary for different topics, but your professor will be able to tell if you actually reviewed the literature or picked the first studies you could find at random. Additionally, if you’re going to cite a piece of information, use reference sections to find where it originally came from. Don’t cite a 2004 study for a piece of data that has been recycled 5 times and actually comes from 1955! If a fact is presented in the introduction, it usually came from somewhere else (again, you can use the references to find it). </p>

        <title>Writing for History</title>
        <p>Among scholars, historians are unique in their pursuit of knowledge from pasts that only get further away rather than clearer as time goes on. The difficulty of sometimes vast amounts of elapsed time combined with the intense and often bewildering particularity of different historical moments can make writing academically about history challenging for students. Read this guide to get an idea of how to think about your task as a historian in training!</p>

            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>Of the several kinds of writing you will be asked to do in your history classes, close readings of a primary source are perhaps the most foundational. A close reading is a paper in which you develop an analytical argument that takes into account the historical context the source is from. The skills you use to write a primary source close reading are transferable to the secondary source critiques that you will be asked to write. Another way to think of these critiques is as a way to <q>test other scholars.</q> Other history papers include papers that put primary and secondary sources in conversation with one another, annotated bibliographies, research prospectuses and comparisons of a historian's versus a popular source's version of an event to elucidate the difference between how historians and how others think about the past.</p>

            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p><q><em>[The purpose] is two-fold: firstly writing is a creative process, so we figure things out as we write, <ellipsis/> but the end goal is to understand the people of the past and why they did things the way they did.</em></q></p>
            <p>Unlike writing in many other academic disciplines, most good historical writing is open and accessible to the general reader. Part of the purpose of historical writing, then, is to bring the stories and patterns of the past to the attention of modern readers. Within these stories and patterns are the figures of the past. These figures can sometimes seem very strange, they can seem evil, they can seem funny, but they are ultimately human beings, and your task as a historian is to make sense of them from their perspectives to the extent to which that's possible<mdash/>and it's a task that is, in fact, impossible. And that's part of what you can love about it: Your job is to try to make sense of a puzzle, always knowing that you can't quite get there.</p>

        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-history-characteristics">
            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>Imagination is really important. <q>Analytical</q> for us isn't like looking through a microscope, but having to really imagine, and being willing to think about things in new ways.</em></q></p>
            <p>Writing for history can be very difficult because you are, in essence, being asked to disregard what you know<mdash/>what your present has taught you<mdash/>and recreate a world that you have never seen and that has ceased existing. For this reason, historical writing is an act of inquiry that is both logical and imaginative. To be a good historian you must begin by making observations and then use these observations to ask good questions that will help you re-imagine the past in a new way or to find the gaps in existing ways of understanding it. These questions and new ways of seeing will allow you to gain a deeper knowledge of the past and, hopefully, a deeper empathy for its figures.</p>
            <p>A second important part of writing historically is understanding that making a historical argument does not mean disregarding your sources to write what you want; rather, it means to allow your observations to help you make a convincing argument by presenting them in the truest possible way: historians feel they have an ethical responsibility to not abuse their evidence, to not do violence to the sources of the past, to not force a source to say something that it did not intend to say. For this reason, when you make an interpretive leap you must justify it so that you do not misrepresent a source.</p>
            <p>This second characteristic of historical writing is often called being <q>value neutral.</q> However, being value neutral doesn't mean that historians don't see things as right and wrong<mdash/>instead it means that in order to actually be able to distinguish one from the other a historian must first begin by understanding the people of the past<mdash/>and you can't do that unless you have put aside your own moral lens long enough to figure them out. Putting aside your lenses is, indeed, the thing that will allow you to ask the questions you will need to ask in order to imagine the past<mdash/>questions that are not merely factual, that are not anachronistic or judgmental, but analytical.</p>

        <title>Writing for International Political Economy</title>
        <p>Writing for International Political Economy (<init>IPE</init>) can be difficult because, although it’s a social science and subscribes to these writing conventions, it requires clearly integrating the social, cultural, economic, and political dimensions of international issues in order to develop sufficient depth into your topic, a task that can initially be overwhelming. Additionally, <init>IPE</init> research is not just an intellectual exercise; it has vast real-world impacts. Policy briefs and theories can shape generations of international relations and have drastic effects on people’s lives around the globe. Therefore, along with learning how to research and organize your ideas, it is important to write with intention and care about the greater implications of what you are arguing. Read this guide to learn more about important aspects of writing for <init>IPE</init>!</p>

            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>The vast majority of <init>IPE</init> writing is explanatory, analytical, and synthetic. Three of the most common types of papers you will be asked to write for <init>IPE</init> are research papers, position papers, and essays analyzing course readings. Research papers require you to find outside sources to formulate and support your argument. Position papers typically include an explanatory portion, as if you were writing a report for your employer about your topic, and an analytical section where you will use <init>IPE</init> theories to evaluate the current state of your topic. In other essays you will be asked an analytical question about readings you have done in class and expected to summarize the authors’ complex arguments, identify points of agreement and disagreement among authors, and incorporate relevant passages from the readings into your writing that elaborate (rather than simply re-state) your point; these essays are an opportunity to deepen and showcase your understanding of the course readings. You may also be asked to write case studies, outlining the development of a particular issue, international relationship, or country over time; policy briefs, summarizing a particular issue, its policy options, and your recommendations; and reflections, where you’ll describe your own personal standpoint on an issue. One of the common writing challenges in these genres is covering enough breadth to develop sufficient depth on your topic. As you write, work to integrate the political, social, cultural, and economic perspectives of your topic and explain in detail how they relate to one another. Also, don’t merely summarize readings, but instead put the authors in conversation with one another; look at the points that authors agree or disagree on and come up with a unique angle on how they speak to each other (for example, how might one author expand upon an idea developed by an earlier author?).</p>

            <p>The purpose of writing in <init>IPE</init> is to develop the written communication skills that will make you most effective in your job when you graduate. Many careers that draw on IPE will require you to write succinctly, and to synthesize complicated international issues into digestible documents that combine many perspectives and nuances. <init>IPE</init> papers are an opportunity for you to develop these skills. They are also an opportunity to test your command of classroom and research material and identify what you don’t know. Putting complicated <init>IPE</init> frameworks, policies, and theories into words is an opportunity for both you and your professors to assess your mastery of the topics and theories at hand. <init>IPE</init> papers are also an opportunity to develop information literacy, to know when more research is needed, and to locate, evaluate, and use scholarly and gray literature effectively as evidence for your argument.</p>

            <p><em><q>It’s vital to be concise, specific, not make generalizations, and not speak vaguely and broadly.</q></em></p>
            <p>The professional world of <init>IPE</init> focuses heavily on international relations and economics, and your writing may be used to make important decisions that have huge impacts on people's lives around the world. Therefore, valuable characteristics of <init>IPE</init> writing include clarity, conciseness, specificity, and consideration of many perspectives of a debate. Though nuance is important, clarity and conciseness are key because many of the topics you will write about are complex and in order for your future employer to be able to make a well supported decision they need to easily and clearly understand the state of the issue from your writing. Specificity is also imperative; broad generalizations and sweeping statements are almost always inaccurate and do not help your reader understand the true nature of the issue you are writing about.</p>
            <p>It is also important to recognize that you will not emerge from your writing with a clear answer to your topic. The top experts on an issue have dedicated their lives to this research and still disagree with one another on the solutions. For all of the scholars with whom you agree, there are scholars who have counterarguments for their points. Therefore, you should work to put authors in conversation with one another and anticipate counterarguments when you are making a claim. Additionally, because <init>IPE</init> theories have real-world impacts, it is crucial to openly evaluate both sides of a debate and really think about the implications.</p>

                    <p>Learning the difference between an opinion and an argument is key for writing a strong <init>IPE</init> paper. An opinion is based on values or beliefs and doesn’t necessarily have to be supported with evidence. You can disregard all of the evidence to the contrary and still hold onto your opinion. An argument must be something about which other reasonable parties could disagree and it must be supportable with evidence. When writing an <init>IPE</init> paper, don’t take off running with your first opinion and try to find sources to support it. Instead, take the time to read sources and build an argument before writing.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>You should not start your paper with broad generalizations such as <q>since the dawn of time<ellipsis/></q> (see <xref ref="list-process-openings-to-avoid"/>).

                    <p>Your professors may disagree about aspects of your paper (such as having a roadmap sentence in your introduction) or emphasize different features (such as having a contained introduction).

            <p><q><em>You shouldn’t be afraid to do proofs.</em></q></p>
            <p>The fundamental genre of writing in mathematics is the proof. In a proof, a mathematician walks through the logical steps from a known statement to prove another statement. Proofs should be devoid of complexity beyond the logical steps required to prove the statement. They range in length from just a few lines to several pages or longer, depending on the complexity of the problem.</p>
            <p>The other genre more common in upper division mathematics classes is a paper using mathematics to solve real-world problems. This genre involves more expository writing, as the problem must be used to write a mathematical model, and then the results of the model must be contextualized with respect to the original problem. They are generally 5-7 pages in length, including graphics. </p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Purpose</title>
                <p>The purpose of writing in mathematics is to work through difficult ideas and communicate them clearly. Writing helps develop and deepen thinking. Proofs are applications of complex concepts and methods learned in class; in order to write them successfully, you have to explore and understand those ideas, a process that facilitates learning.</p>
                <p>In the professional mathematical world, a proof is also something more, a way of demonstrating (proving!) previously unknown knowledge to the academic community. While student proofs are not usually new discoveries, they require the student to practice the same kinds of thinking and logical moves required for more advanced academic work. </p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>Erdős (a famous mathematician) said that God has a book with all the proofs in it… and when you wrote a nice proof he would say, ‘oh, that’s from the book.’</em></q></p>
            <p>Precision and concision are the most highly valued characteristics in mathematical writing. Precision means that the piece of writing is logically correct. You cannot write a good proof without correct logic. Concision means that the ideas are communicated efficiently, without anything unnecessary included. For example, if you’re using a theorem from the book, cite it instead of writing the entire thing out again. Avoid unnecessary explanations like “now I will show that X is 3…” instead, simply show it. Concision also means knowing your audience and not including details they would already know. For most proofs, the expected audience is another student doing reasonably well in your class, who wouldn’t need to see every basic algebraic step you took. If, for example, you already covered solving systems of equations in class, there’s no need to list every step you used to solve a system. You can simply tell the reader what technique you used and what the results were. Concision, along with mathematical elegance, also means using big theorems that move the proof along in fewer steps. A good proof does its work as efficiently as possible, without descending into detailed computations where they aren’t needed. </p>
            <p>To write concisely, also keep in mind that a proof is the logic itself, not the story of how you worked it out. X did not become three when you figured it out; it always was three, and you simply discovered that fact. In the process of writing a proof, you will likely struggle down many dead ends, but the final project should only include the most efficient logical steps. </p>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p>Pre-existing theorems and definitions are important starting evidence, which are generally cited from the textbook. Mathematical equations, incorporated into the text in complete sentences, also provide evidence. In more applied projects, working out specific cases or examples of a theorem can also provide important explanation. Longer projects might also cite mathematical literature, usually books and occasionally journal articles. </p>

                <li><p>Proofs are written in the present tense using the first person plural (<q>we</q>). Write as though you are walking through the logical steps with the reader.</p></li>
                <li><p>Choose notation carefully and define variables, parameters, and constants clearly when they are introduced. </p></li>
                <li><p>While expressions are used in text, don’t use shorthand like replacing the words “less than” with the <q>&lt;</q> symbol.</p></li>
                <li><p>Be thoughtful when inserting graphics: use consistent designs that convey contents clearly, and be sure to reference them in the text.</p></li>
                <li><p>Mathematical writing is generally done in <latex/>, a document markup language. This makes proper formatting of equations in text much more elegant.</p></li>
                <li><p>Most professors return incomplete or incorrect proofs for revisions. This is an important part of the learning process; be comfortable with working through revisions several times. </p></li>
                <li><p>When writing about equations or formulas, remember that they exist and are not evolving or springing into being. Refer to them as factual entities that simply <em>are</em>. </p></li>

            <p>Some music-writing genres<mdash/>the sort that require extensive knowledge of terminology<mdash/>are limited to music majors and include analytical papers in which you will look at a score and make an argument about it using technical descriptions of its subtleties as evidence.

These less technical papers include a version of the analytical paper, where you write a listening guide for a piece of music; book reviews, patterned after professional book reviews, where you review books dealing with musical issues; field work papers, where you analyze the interaction between music and culture on or off campus; reception histories, where you describe the reception of a particular composer when they were alive, and analyze why and how that reception changed over time; broader versions of reception histories, where you take a work where there is a critical mass of scholarship and then combine analysis, history, and criticism of that work; performance reports, informal pieces of writing where you describe what you heard at a performance, what the event was like, and how the audience responded; as well as conventional research papers.</p>

            <p>Like most endeavors, writing academically about music has many entwined purposes. First of all, writing about music will help you learn about music. This will mean going beyond your subjective reaction to a score and exploring the details of its artistry. Further, by learning to write well about music, you will also foster writing skills that you will be able to apply to other kinds of writing that you will do in future. Still more, by writing papers about music, you will be joining a scholarly conversation, whose complex and multifarious voices will push you to evaluate complex arguments and learning how to persuade others yourself.</p>

            <p><q><em>How the heck do you write about sound?</em></q></p>
            <p>One of the greatest stumbling blocks for new music writers can sometimes be the thing that drew you to music in the first place; we have all heard music, and we love it and know how important it is. But being able to transform that love into a profound and specific analysis of the <q>hows</q> and <q>whys</q> of a chosen piece of music is an exercise in patience and practice. But hang in there! That exercise will lead you to a deeper appreciation for music than you began with.</p>
            <p>When you are writing about texts, you are using words to analyze words. However, when writing about musical texts, the thing you are analyzing is sound, which is invisible. So in order to write well about music you will need to meaningfully translate what you hear into writing.</p>
            <p>When you are trying to do the work of such meaningful translation, when you are listening to and looking at a score, there will always be an infinite number of ways of looking at it, some of which are more persuasive and reasonable than others. In order to write persuasively, and choose which way to <q>look</q> at a score or even a book, the most important thing to keep in mind is to go beyond description. While description is a great starting point<mdash/>because good description ensures that you are paying attention and noticing what is unusual<mdash/>analysis requires explaining why that something is unusual or significant.</p>

            <p>In your music classes, just like your English and history classes, evidence is almost exclusively textual.

                <li><p>Describing music involves using a series of agreed-upon metaphors (e.g. a wet sound v. a dry sound). While such terminology can be daunting, it can be very helpful when writing about sound.</p></li>
                <li><p>With the above tip in mind, there is sometimes a misconception that when you are writing about music it has to be really jargon-laden and technical. If you are uncomfortable with writing about music, it is always better to say what you have to say clearly rather than throwing words out like a cloud of squid ink.</p></li>
                <li><p>Because music takes place in time, there is a tendency to work your way through a piece that you are writing about from beginning to end.

			<title>Writing for Philosophy</title>
				<introduction>
					<p>Writing for philosophy is all about arguments.  Philosophy essays create a conversation between the arguments of others and the author's own arguments, for the purpose of answering a philosophical question. While somewhat similar in structure to papers in other disciplines, philosophy papers follow unique conventions. Read this section to learn how to write a top-notch paper for your philosophy class!</p>
				</introduction>
                <note>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, all italicized quotes throughout this section are excerpted from the interview with Philosophy faculty members at the University of Puget Sound that informed this section.</p>
        </note>
				<paragraphs>
					<title>Genres</title>
					<p><q><em>Have a question that you’re answering, look at a couple of different answers to that question, then explain what your answer is and why you’re not answering the question in other ways.</em></q></p>
					<p>The fundamental genre of philosophy is the argumentative essay. These are centered around a thesis that clearly states a position and develops a sustained argument for that position. In addition, philosophy papers have a few unique emphases. First, most papers include one or multiple counterarguments to the author’s claim. A good paper will fully explain these counterarguments and then defend against them; this should be a real section of the paper, not just an afterthought in the conclusion. Second, philosophy papers often use fewer sources than research papers in other disciplines. Using a few sources very fully and intentionally is much better than pulling in a lot of outside information in a cursory way. Finally, philosophy papers are often shorter than big research papers in other disciplines. However, this doesn’t mean that they are easier to write. Every sentence is important; a good paper might start at ten pages and be edited down to five. Papers in philosophy are generally single-authored, especially at the student level.</p>
				</paragraphs>
				<paragraphs>
					<title>Purpose</title>
					<p><q><em>Writing in philosophy... serves as a way of clarifying one's own views. Just going through that process of having to write it out helps people figure out what they believe.</em></q></p>
					<p>The purpose of writing in philosophy is to defend or clarify a philosophical position or view, contributing to a conversation that can take place across time and space. A good paper presents one or several existing positions on a topic, develops its own position, and responds to potential counterarguments. Writing in this field should be interesting and accessible to any intelligent reader, not just members of a specialized academic community. While potentially less complex, student papers serve this purpose in the same way a professional academic’s would.  Writing a philosophy paper can also serve to clarify your own thinking about an issue: the process of interrogating your argument and considering counterarguments can help you realize what you believe and why you believe it!</p>
				</paragraphs>
				<paragraphs>
					<title>Valued Characteristics</title>
					<p><q><em>You should be constantly telling me what you're going to do. Like this that you're discussing on page three... what exactly is that relation to what you said on page two? Make that as explicit as you can as opposed to allowing your reader to sort of guess.</em></q></p>
					<p>Again, writing for philosophy is all about making an argument. A very clear argumentative thesis is the most important part of your paper. Make sure you know what you’re arguing and sustain the argument throughout the paper, laying it out clearly for your reader. Clarity is one of the most important elements of a good philosophy paper. Philosophical ideas can be confusing; don’t make them more difficult by trying to use artsy language! Likewise, philosophy papers should be clearly organized and roadmapped. Don’t be afraid to tell the reader exactly what you’re going to argue in each paragraph. Phrases like <q>Now I will argue…</q> are great here. Carefully chosen examples also make your argument more clear.</p>
					<p>Creativity of thought is also valued in philosophy. Even if a text has been analyzed for centuries, think about novel perspectives you can bring to the conversation!</p>
					<p>A good paper almost always presents a charitable, comprehensive summary of the perspective of at least one author’s argument. Read the argument you’re using several times and make sure you can explain it clearly. Charitable analysis is key: don’t try to make the position weak so it’s easy to argue against. A more nuanced, challenging argument will make a better paper.</p>
                    </paragraphs>
                    <paragraphs>
                    <title>Evidence</title>
                    <p><q><em>It’s a matter of using sources to create this conversation, this dialectic.</em></q></p>
                    <p>Use of evidence in philosophy papers can take several forms. Evidence can be textual, often in the form of explaining an argument written by another author. These arguments should be put in conversation with each other. While quotes are okay, a good explanation of an author’s argument is often best. Remember to cite properly and to clearly distinguish the point of view you are paraphrasing from your own.</p>
                    <p>Empirical evidence<mdash/>such as for instance data from the fields of neuroscience or psychology<mdash/>can also be used to back up claims and support your argument. Avoid making broad claims about human nature without this kind of support. This form of evidence should also be cited.</p>
                    <p>Philosophy values logical thought, so some forms of evidence that aren’t common in other disciplines are also valid. These include thought experiments or well-thought-out examples or counterexamples that provide proof for a point. These often won’t come from an outside source and don’t need to be cited.</p>
					<p>Again, using a few sources thoroughly and purposefully is better than picking facts from a wide number of sources.</p>
				</paragraphs>
				<paragraphs>
					<title>Conventions and Tips</title>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Clarity of language is valued over style. Don’t be afraid to use repetitive language if it’s the clearest way to state something.</p></li>
						<li><p>Clearly define any jargon you use.</p></li>
						<li><p>Carefully distinguish between your argument and others you introduce. Cite (see <xref ref="citations"/>)!</p></li>
						<li><p>Use of <q>I</q> is encouraged in philosophy papers, and helpful to distinguish between your argument or contribution and the other arguments you are using. Distinguishing your novel contribution from the arguments of others is key!</p></li>
						<li><p>Clearly roadmap your paper. Tell the reader <q>In this section I will be arguing . . .</q>, tell them <q>In this section I argued . . . .</q> Do all the work for them.</p></li>
						<li><p>In the same vein . . . use of subsections with headings is encouraged, especially for longer papers.</p></li>
						<li><p>The target audience for philosophy papers is an intelligent reader who is interested in philosophy but has no background on the topic. Your paper should make it clear and interesting to them.</p></li>
						<li><p>Engaging your reader in the introduction is important, but avoid cliches and broad sweeping statements.</p></li>
						<li><p>Outlines (see <xref ref="outlining"/>) and reverse outlines (see <xref ref="reverse-outlining"/>) are useful planning tools that will help confirm that your argument is cohesive!</p></li>

            <p>There are two main kinds of writing in psychology. The first is research reports, in which you will convey to your audience the research you have done, the reason you did it, what method you did it by, and the results and conclusions you arrived at. The second type of writing you will do is literature reviews, in which you will write papers focused on canvassing a particular area of research to generate new conclusions about that area. Another type of writing you may be asked to do that is less common is translational writing, in which you will be asked to <q>translate</q> scientific writing for general audiences.</p>

            <p>The purpose of writing in psychology is, at its most fundamental level, to communicate our understanding of behavior and mental processes. Because knowledge in psychology can make a good and meaningful difference in the lives of people, it is paramount that your writing is understandable. In order to promote meaningful change in people's lives, you must first be able to communicate the findings of empirical research effectively to both other scientists and larger audiences.</p>

            <title>Traits and Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>The goal is to be honest.</em></q></p>
            <p>Because psychology is a science and psychological writing is used to change how individuals and societies think about and treat others, it is crucial that arguments are made honestly and using empirical data. In your essays, it's therefore important that you prioritize presenting your data fairly over pushing your own interpretation of the data. Instead, while you make your argument you should allow room for alternate explanations: be honest about what you know and what you don't know and recognize the limitations of your argument.</p>
            <p>In your attempt to be as honest as possible with your findings, you will be aided by being precise and concise rather than ambiguous and flowery. It is difficult to be straightforward if your writing is confusing or vague about what your results actually are and how you obtained them.</p>
            <p>While presenting the facts of your research clearly and plainly is vital, it is equally important to <q>go beyond the data</q> by writing about its applied relevance in interdisciplinary and ethical spaces.</p>

        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-psychology-evidence">

            <p><q><em>In psychology, you can almost never see the thing you want to know<nbsp/><ellipsis/><nbsp/></em></q></p>
            <p>The data you use should be empirical rather than textual. For this reason, a theory from a secondary source is not evidence, and most professors discourage the use of quotes. However, while psychological data is scientific, <em>how</em> you interpret it is inherently qualitative. While in the natural sciences, for example, if you want to know the temperature at which a metal melts, you can take a thermometer and watch and see when it melts and you'll know the answer: you can observe the physical process you want to know about directly. In psychology you can almost never see the psychological process you want to know about because it's inside a person. For example, you could have an idea that a pharmaceutical increases hunger and then, when you give this pharmaceutical to people they eat more. Did the pharmaceutical increase hunger? Possibly. That's a good possible explanation for what happened, but you didn't see hunger, you just saw eating and you have to make a link between what you saw (which was people eating) and the underlying thing you think is in there (which is hunger). In this way, while the data you collect are wholly scientific, the way you choose to explain that evidence is, by nature, conjectural.</p>

        	<p>Though the ultimate goal of writing in Spanish is to achieve fluency, it cannot be achieved without both the mastery of grammatical concepts and critical, original thinking about relevant topics. In other words, grammatical correctness and original expression are equally important. By encouraging writers to think about different topics and ideas that arise through reading literature in Spanish and watching films, writing assignments in Spanish help students become <q>speakers of Spanish<mdash/>who are prepared to speak their minds in any situation<mdash/>rather than linguists.</q></p>

        	<p><q><em>Persuasion is not synonymous with categorical assertiveness. Spanish writers demonstrate more politeness and openness to perspectives than English writers.</em></q></p>
        	<p>Writers in Spanish are expected to dedicate an equal amount of time and space to a variety of viewpoints throughout a paper. In English, it is often accepted to have one paragraph or even one sentence that discusses and refutes opposing viewpoints, but this is not sufficient in Spanish. Nuance and close reading are key to achieving the kind of paper that devotes equal attention to a variety of viewpoints, but it is important to remember that everything must still relate back to the thesis. If an alternative viewpoint contradicts the thesis, the writer must also refute that viewpoint such that faithfulness to the thesis is maintained. </p>
        	<p>Don’t summarize. While a paper must demonstrate that a writer has closely read a text, writers must also offer insight beyond summarization of the plot. Like all academic writing, literary and film analysis papers in Spanish must add to an ongoing conversation about the text and themes– a summary offers nothing to add.</p>

While it may be tempting to use the text as a springboard to talk about the sociopolitical context of the time the text was written or about something that’s happening in the “real world”<mdash/>and while this is not only acceptable but highly valued in other disciplines<mdash/>papers in Spanish must remain grounded in the text. The text provides clues about themes that the author is thinking about, and the writer’s goal is to uncover these themes and defend them using those very clues from the text.</p>

			<title>Writing Lab Reports</title>
				<introduction>
					<p>Lab reports are a common genre of writing used in the sciences to convey the results of a scientific experiment and place them in the context of knowledge in the field. Do not underestimate the importance of the report: a scientific experiment has little value if its purpose and results are not communicated clearly! Lab reports are also a building block to writing a publishable thesis or scientific paper. While lab reports in most scientific disciplines have similar sections and share some stylistic expectations, emphases and conventions vary across disciplines. As a student in the sciences, engaging with these differences will help you apply your scientific writing skills in different classes.</p>
					<p>Structure is important to lab reports in all scientific disciplines, and with some variations they use the same basic sections. This chapter includes an overview of the basic principles of each lab report section and uses examples from different scientific disciplines to examine the similarities and differences between them. The focus is on biology and chemistry, the disciplines where most students write lab reports at the 100- and 200- level. However, the general sections should be useful for other disciplines as well. While sections are presented in order here, it’s much easier to write out of order: begin with the methods and results, then move to the introduction and discussion, and write the abstract last!</p>
					<note>
						<title>Examples</title>
						<p>Biology examples are drawn from student work from Biology 111, written on an experiment about photosynthesis in <taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon>. Chemistry examples are drawn from student work from Chemistry 110, written about experiments to determine the identity of unknown gasses or unknown salts. They are student work and not perfect in every way, but useful for examining these concepts! For another example of an exemplary annotated upper-division lab report in biology, see the <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/departments-and-programs/undergraduate/biology/for-current-students/">biology department student webpage</url>. In addition, handouts and examples from your professor are always an excellent resource, as are published scientific papers in your discipline.</p>

						<title>Style for Lab Reports</title>
						<p>Technical writing in the sciences uses clear, concise style with somewhat strict conventions. One source of confusion is the use of active and passive voice, which is an ongoing debate in scientific fields. Proponents of passive voice suggest that it maintains scientific impersonality, while those who prefer active voice argue that it is clearer or that authors should claim ownership of their work. Use of passive voice in the sciences may be declining (check out <url href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40554-017-0045-5">this article</url>). For more on the mechanics of passive and active voice, see <xref ref="style-using-passive-cautiously"/>. For other disciplinary stylistic preferences, see the section of this chapter focused on your discipline.</p>

					<title>Abstracts</title>
					<p>The abstract summarizes the whole paper in about 200 words. It should include 1-2 sentences on each section of the lab report: some context from the introduction, the basic methods, some important results, and a few takeaways from the discussion. These statements should be concise, with specific results instead of sweeping statements. The abstract should stand alone: a scientifically literate person who just reads the abstract should have a reasonable understanding of the experiment and its results. Abstracts are similar across disciplines. </p>

						<blockquote>
						<p>Plants adapt to environmental fluctuations by changing how they manage energy. Photosynthesis occurs in plants as both light-dependent and light-independent reactions. Chlorophylls within plant cells are responsible for harnessing light energy and water in order to create oxygen, ATP, and NADPH. This experiment studied the effect of various light intensities on oxygen gas production as a measure of photosynthetic activity, in order to see if the oxygen production rate increased with available light energy. Samples of <taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon> were dark adapted and oxygen production was measured at various light intensities (0, 10, 30, 50, 80, 140, 200, and 380 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m>). The average rate of change in dissolved oxygen for 0 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m> was -0.162 0.154 mg/L,hr due to the intake of oxygen through cellular respiration. <taxon><taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon></taxon> shows the most efficient use of light energy for <m>\text{O}_2</m> production at 80 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m> and plateaued around 0.9 mg/L/hr for any higher light intensity. This suggests that photosynthetic activity can only perform efficiently at certain light intensities, confirming trends from research with photosynthetic algae. Further research should investigate the limiting factors on photosynthetic activity and evolutionary drivers and discrepancies between organisms.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>This example does a decent job of addressing every aspect of the lab report. The first three sentences address the introduction, summarizing the most essential information. The fourth sentence states the question and study aims, and the fifth sentence summarizes the methods. Sentences 6 and 7 give the most important results, including numeric values. Finally, sentences 8 and 9 summarize the discussion and future directions. Obviously, this is more easily said than done, especially with longer or more complicated lab reports. Be sure to remove every unnecessary word or phrase and any repetitive information. Concision is key!</p>

						<title>Abstract: Chemistry</title>
						<blockquote>
						<p>Gasses can be impossible to identify visually, but their other physical characteristics, like flammability, smell, and molar mass, are well documented. The objective of this experiment was to determine the identity of three unknown gasses. Molar mass was determined using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, and a container of known volume. Flammability was determined using flame tests. Similar gasses were distinguished using a limewater test. Based on a molar mass of 39.97601g/mol, lack of flammability, and formation of a precipitate in a limewater test, unknown gas one was determined to be <m>\text{CO}_2</m>. Based on a molar mass of 35.9581g/mol and lack of flammability or a precipitate in a limewater test, unknown gas 2 was determined to be Ar. Based on an experimental molar mass of 42.5765g/mol and a positive flame test, unknown gas 3 was determined to be <m>\text{C}_3\text{H}_{8(g)}</m>.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>This example includes a quick overview of each part of the lab report. The first 2 sentences summarize the introduction, the next three sentences summarize the experimental section, and the last three sentences summarize the results and conclusions, including specific important numerical results. This is an easier task with a short report like this than with a long, complex lab report, but the fundamentals are the same: be concise and be organized!</p>

					<title>Introductions</title>
					<p>The introduction presents (1) the primary/secondary literature or known scientific background that contextualizes the experiment and (2) the objectives of your current experiment. Introductions generally follow what’s called an ‘inverted triangle’ format: they begin by broadly introducing the topic, then zoom in on the specific focus, then identify the unresolved question you’re trying to answer, and end with the objectives of the experiment you performed to answer that question. In biology, the introduction should discuss published peer-reviewed studies in this line of research, and how their results lead into the experiment you did. In chemistry, intro level lab reports may only require background information from your textbook, while higher level reports should include primary literature. Introductions in biology often start with a broader focus, while in chemistry they come more quickly to the specifics of the experimental work.</p>
					<note><title>Literature for intro-level lab reports</title> For lab reports in intro-level science classes, your experiment probably doesn’t make ground-breaking contributions to the field, so justifying the pressing questions it addresses can feel slightly forced. However, scientific literature that will give context to your work definitely exists; if you're having trouble finding it, ask your professor, a tutor, or a librarian.</note>
					<note><title>Quoting in lab reports.</title> Avoid quotes in lab reports unless copying the exact language used by your source is vital. Most evidence comes in the form of paraphrase and numerical results instead. Remember that you still have to cite paraphrased information!</note>
					<note><title>Variation within fields</title> Some courses, like biochemistry and molecular biology, may combine approaches from biology and chemistry. These biology courses, for example, are more methodologically focused and reports may be less broad. If you’re uncertain what’s expected, always ask your professor!</note>

						<title>Introduction: Biology</title>
						<blockquote>
						<p>The primary source of energy for nearly all life comes from the sun. Plants use photosynthesis to transform light radiation from the sun, carbon dioxide, and water into usable chemical energy stored in sugars.  Photosynthesis is a process involving light-independent and light-dependent reactions that occur in the chloroplast of a plant cell. In light-dependent reactions, the pigment chlorophyll absorbs light energy in the form of a photon. When the energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, it causes an electron to “jump” to its next orbital. This causes photosystem II to begin. Through PSII, water molecules are split to replace the electron and oxygen is released as a waste product.   The electron is then used to provide energy to create a H+ gradient that ATP Synthase uses to transfer energy in the form of ATP.  The next step in light-dependent reactions is through photosystem I.  In PSI, an electron from PSII replaces the “lost” electron.  This electron then moves through an electron transport chain where its last electron acceptor is NADP, becoming energy in the form of NADPH.  The ATP and NADPH produced through these light-dependent reactions are then used to complete the light-independent stage two of photosynthesis, or the Calvin cycle (Campbell et al. 2009).  For the purposes of this experiment, we will focus solely on the light-dependent reactions that occur during photosynthesis.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>This first paragraph begins broadly by establishing the context and significance of photosynthesis as a biological process. In biology papers, breadth is important, because biology is concerned with complex living systems. Quickly, the author transitions into providing more focused background information on the details of photosynthesis that are relevant to this experiment. Arguably, some of the details included here aren’t actually important to the experiment, which just requires an understanding of the importance of light and production of Oxygen.</p>
						<blockquote><p>Past research has shown that an increase in light intensity has a positive effect on photosynthetic activity specifically in six species of marine phytoplankton.  Researchers varied the amount of light each phytoplankton was exposed to and respective <m>\text{O}_2</m> levels were recorded.  The results showed a direct relationship between the increase in light intensity and <m>\text{O}_2</m> production up to a certain point.  After this peak was reached, <m>\text{O}_2</m> levels leveled off.  This suggests that light does not always directly equal photosynthetic activity (Falkowski and Owens, 1978).</p></blockquote>
						<p>This paragraph reviews published, peer reviewed literature related to the lab topic, which can be found through <custom ref="library"/>. This example does a good job summarizing the main take-aways of the study instead of leaving readers to try to figure them out themselves and also uses paraphrasing effectively. While the citation used here is correct, the writer could also choose to credit the authors of the study more directly. This might look like opening the paragraph with the phrase <q>In their 1978 study, Falkowski and Owens showed that an increase in light intensity…</q></p>
						<p>For an intro-level lab like this, only citing one study may be just fine. However, for a 200+ level class, find several articles that lead to your research question. What <em>unknowns</em> or <em>gaps in literature</em> does your experiment address? Maybe the relationship between light intensity and photosynthesis has been thoroughly studied in phytoplankton, but your experiment contributes by studying it in plants instead. Even if your experiment is investigating things that are already well understood in existing science, published studies provide context. Be sure to make the connections between studies you cite and your own experiment clear. A more advanced lab report would have several paragraphs about different elements of important background literature, each containing information from a few published studies that lead to the question proposed by the lab.</p>
						<blockquote><p>In this study, we examined photosynthetic activity at different light intensities in the aquatic plant <taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon>. Because light energy is essential to begin photosynthesis, we hypothesize that increasing the light intensity will subsequently increase photosynthetic activity, showing an increase in the level of dissolved oxygen. Conversely, the plants exposed to no light in this experiment should be forced to use oxygen to survive, showing a decrease in the level of dissolved oxygen. Additionally, we hypothesize that the plants may reach their peak production capacity making the increase in light intensity no longer advantageous after this peak and therefore will not increase photosynthetic activity past this point.</p></blockquote>
						<p>The final paragraph introduces the study you did, your hypothesis, and your predictions. While you don’t need to include details of the methods, you should include a quick overview and definitely introduce your study system (or the plant/animal/cell type/other you worked with). This example introduces the study system (<taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon>) but it would be stronger if it included some justification of why this is a good study system for the experiment at hand. This could be super simple, like <q>...in the aquatic plant <taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon>, which was selected because it is well-studied and easy to care for in the lab (citation needed).</q></p>
						<p>This student explains the reasons for their predictions and connects photosynthesis to the variable measured, dissolved oxygen. The prediction is directly related to the results of the published study cited above, but also novel because it uses a different organism. This paragraph could be more clear about what the study will achieve, although this can be difficult to articulate for labs that aren’t actually novel research. An example would be adding this sentence to the end: <q>This research improves our understanding of the limits of photosynthesis for plants like <taxon>Elodea Canadensis</taxon> and will help determine sunlight needs and optimum growing conditions for this species.</q></p>

						<title>Introduction: Chemistry</title>
						<blockquote><p>Gasses can be difficult to identify due to their similarities in appearance. However, various physical characteristics of gases are well-documented and can be used for identification. These include molar mass, flammability, smell, and reactivity with other chemicals.</p>
						<p>Determining the molar mass of a gas is possible thanks to the ideal gas law, PV=nRT, which was created by Émile Clapeyron in 1834 by combining previous gas laws (Flowers et al. 2015). The ideal gas law can be used to determine how many moles of a known gas or gas mixture, like air, fit into a flask. Italian chemist Amedeo Avogadro determined that an equal volume of two different gasses at the same temperature and pressure would consist of the same number of moles, so by calculating how many moles of a known gas fit in a container we can assume that the same number of moles of an unknown gas fit in the same container under equivalent environmental conditions (Flowers et al 2015). By determining the number of moles and the mass we can determine the molar mass, an important clue to identify the gas.</p>
						<p>In this lab, we will use standard techniques including flame tests and determining molar mass to examine the properties of three unknown gasses. The properties of the unknowns will be compared to literature values for different gasses in order to identify them.</p></blockquote>
						<p>For lab reports in general Chemistry, you may not be expected to write an introduction. This is because these labs are focused on learning experimental methods and chemical principles, so less background is required to place them in the context of scientific literature in the field. This introduction focuses on giving relevant background information on the techniques used and laying out the objective of the lab, and is notably shorter than the biology example. The only cited source is the textbook. For upper division chemistry work, you should provide more substantive background information, including citing the original papers that pioneered this synthesis, experiment, etc. Also look into how the experiment applies to real life of the field more broadly: does it have functional applications, or is it used in making everyday products? Still, introductions for chemistry lab reports will generally start less broad than those for biology.</p>
						<p>The last paragraph addresses the objective of the lab. In this example, hypotheses or predictions are not included because there aren’t yet any clues as to the identity of the gasses.</p>

					<title>Materials and Methods or Experimental Sections</title>
					<p>Materials and methods sections (in biology) or experimental sections (in chemistry) contain a straightforward explanation of how you carried out your lab experiment, addressing any methodological choice that may have impacted your results. They should be written with enough detail that a trained scientist in the field could duplicate the experiment. This should include details like chemical concentrations and number of replicates. However, you don’t need to explain standard techniques that someone with in-field knowledge would understand. Also avoid giving a historical narration of what you did: for example, <q>Professor Saucedo brought us the solution and we began to pipette it</q> is unnecessary detail. If the logic behind a specific method isn’t obvious, include a brief explanation. The style and content of materials and methods or experimental sections is similar between biology and chemistry, but chemistry has a more standardized subheading structure for distinguishing between experiments and general information.</p>
					<note><title>Style for Materials and Methods/Experimental Sections</title>In terms of style, the Materials and Methods/ Experimental section is written in past tense, because the experimental work took place in the past. Stylistic preference for active or passive voice can vary.</note>
					<example>
						<title>Materials and Methods Section: Biology</title>
						<blockquote><p>In order to measure the photosynthetic activity of <taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon>, many 10 cm sprigs were dark adapted (deprived of light for a minimum of four hours). One glass bottle was then filled with 500 mL of 0.1% sodium bicarbonate solution. The initial oxygen content of the solution was measured using an oxygen meter (Extech Model 407510) while stirring for 60 seconds. Two 10 cm sprigs of the dark-adapted <taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon> were then placed into the bottle and capped. The bottle was placed in front of a bank of lights on a light table and left at a specified light intensity for 90 minutes. Light intensities were manipulated by changing the distance from a lightbulb. The specified light intensities utilized within all lab sections were 0, 10, 30, 50, 80, 140, 200, and 380 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m> and were measured with a light meter (Li-Cor LI189). After 90 minutes, the <taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon> was removed and the final dissolved oxygen of the solution was measured in the same way as before (same procedure as initial reading). Seven independent trials were performed at each light intensity. The average changes in dissolved oxygen content were normalized as rate per hour (mg/L-hr) for each light intensity and were analyzed by standard error.</p></blockquote>
						<p>This is a great example of using an appropriate level of detail. It includes everything another scientist might need to know to replicate the experiment, like the light intensity measurements and time periods. Details such as the specific instruments used should be included paranthetically. However, it doesn’t include details that might appear in the lab handout but another scientist could do differently or figure out on their own (for example, how to cut sprigs of <taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon>, how to use a stir plate, or the bottle sizes used for the experiments). One weakness of this example is the underdeveloped data analysis section, which comes at the end of the paragraph. The phrase <q>analyzed by standard error</q> is unclear and lacks detail. For longer reports the data analysis section of the methods should be its own paragraph or even an independent subsection, although this depends on the number of statistical analyses conducted. It should be clear to the reader how data were processed and what groups were compared in the statistics.</p>
						<p>This section is written in past-tense <xref ref="style-using-passive-cautiously" text="custom">passive voice</xref>, which is common for materials and methods sections. Another appropriate style would be past-tense active voice. The first sentence, re-written in active voice, could read like this: <q>In order to measure the photosynthetic activity of <taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon>, <em>we</em> dark-adapted many 10 cm sprigs by depriving them of light for a minimum of four hours.</q></p>
					</example>
					<example>
						<title>Experimental Section: Chemistry</title>
						<blockquote><p><em>General.</em> All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. All reactions were performed at room temperature and atmospheric pressure unless otherwise noted.</p>
						<p><em>Unknown Cation Determination.</em> Solutions of 0.10 M sodium sulfate, sodium phosphate, sodium chromate (10 drops each), and sodium molybdate (20 drops) were added to individual wells in a 24-well plate, followed by 10 drops of a solution of unknown salt (0.50 g) in deionized water (5 mL). The resulting solutions in the well plates were gently stirred by rotating the plate in circles. The wells were examined against a black background for the appearance of precipitates. A flame test was performed by dipping a wire loop into the solution of unknown salt, holding the loop in a Bunsen burner flame, and noting the color of the resulting flame.</p>
						<p><em>Unknown Anion Determination.</em> Solutions of bromine, chlorine, and iodine were prepared in three separate test tubes and mixed vigorously. The bromine solution was orange and composed of 10 drops of 6M KBr solution, 20 drops of hexane, 2 drops of 6M <m>\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4</m> and 3 drops <m>\text{H}_2\text{O}_2</m> (3%). The yellow chlorine solution was prepared with 10 drops of (5%) NaClO solution, 20 drops of hexane, and 5 drops 6M HCl. Finally, the iodine solution was purple and composed of 10 drops 6M KI solution, 20 drops of hexane, 2 drops 6M <m>\text{H}_2\text{SO}_4</m> and 3 drops <m>\text{H}_2\text{O}_2</m> (3%). A small amount of the unknown salt, covering just the tip of the spatula was added to each test tube. The mixtures were shaken vigorously until the halide ion mixed with the halogen in the hexane layer. The color of the hexane layer either changed or remained the same depending on if a reaction occurred. By comparing the colors of previous mixed solutions, the unknown anion was identified through color matching.</p></blockquote>
						<p>In chemistry, this section is called the experimental section. It should be divided using subheadings into a <q>general</q> section and a section for each experiment, with the subheadings bolded and each followed with a period like in the example above. Each section should be about one paragraph in length. This is an example of how structure in chemistry often is a bit more rigid than in biology. Similar to the biology example, this example demonstrates an appropriate level of detail to repeat the experiment but nothing extra like the details of standard techniques or what type of glassware the author used. For chemistry, it’s important to include the concentrations and exact quantities of reagents and their physical state (gas, aqueous, etc.). Also include details like the source of reagents and temperature and pressure, as they can impact outcomes.</p>
						<p>This section is written in past tense <xref ref="style-using-passive-cautiously" text="custom">passive voice</xref>. This is conventional for chemistry experimental sections. It is also conventional to avoid starting sentences with numbers.</p>
					</example>
				</subsection> 
				<subsection>
					<title>Results</title>
					<p>The results section should present the findings of your experiment without interpretation. This section often includes figures or tables, figure captions, and the important results presented in paragraph form. For biology, figure captions should include sufficient detail that the figure would make sense without the context of the results section. For chemistry, the caption should include enough information that a reader can understand the figure but it does not need to stand alone. One of the most challenging parts of a results section is deciding which results to present in paragraph form. Focus on the most important trends or findings for answering your research question. Present these results as clearly as possible, using references to figures and results of statistical tests to back them up. The content and style of results sections is similar between biology and chemistry. However, watch out for differences in formatting for figures, tables, and figure captions.</p>
					<insight><p>When chosing results to report, pick numbers like means or effect sizes that may be more meaningful to a reader who doesn’t understand every aspect of the experiment.</p></insight>
					<note><title>Style</title>Like the Materials and Methods/ Experimental section, results should be written in the past tense.</note>
					<note><title>Referencing figures, tables, appendices, and statistical results</title> All of these elements should be referenced parenthetically in the sentence containing the results they support. For example, if figure 1 contained information on tree height, the reference might look like, <q>Trees on the east side of the valley were on average 6 feet higher than trees on the west side (figure 1).</q> All figures and tables should be referenced before they appear in the text. When reporting statistical results, ask your professor for an example of the exact formatting. Great examples can be found in the <url href="https://edblogs.pugetsound.edu/ecology-statsguide/">Ecology stats guide</url>.</note>
					<example>
						<title>Results: Biology</title>
						<blockquote><p>The lowest light intensity (0 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m>) showed the lowest and only negative average change in dissolved oxygen (<m>\Delta\text{DO}</m>), at <m>-0.162\pm0.058</m> mg/L-hr (Figure 1). At light intensities of 10 and 30 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m> the <m>\Delta\text{DO}</m> increased from <m>0.267\pm0.038</m> to <m>0.562\pm0.062</m> mg/L, hr for a 53% increase in average <m>\Delta\text{DO}</m>. From light intensities 30 to 50 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m> the average <m>\Delta\text{DO}</m> increased 11% (to <m>0.562\pm0.062</m> to <m>0.762\pm0.021</m> mg/L, hr). The standard errors of average <m>\Delta\text{DO}</m> for light intensities 0 to 50 fell between .04 to .06 without any overlap, and thus were all statistically different from one another. There was a notable increase (over 200%) in <m>\text{O}_2</m> production from light intensity 0 to 80 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m>, and a generally positive relationship between light intensity and <m>\Delta\text{DO}</m> from 0 to 80 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m>. <m>\Delta\text{DO}</m> plateaued after 80 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m>. The <m>\Delta\text{DO}</m> at light intensities 80, 140, 200, and 380 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m> were not statistically different from each other, and ranged from 0.7 to 1.1 mg/L, hr (including overlapping standard error).</p></blockquote>
						<p>This paragraph lays out the notable results, reporting numeric values and trends. One strength of this example is that in addition to raw number values the author reports percent increase between groups, which gives a clearer sense of the magnitude of change. They also focus on important trends and leave out details that are less important to interpreting the results, like the individual values of <m>\Delta\text{DO}</m> at the high light intensities. Simply listing data in a results section is not an effective way to communicate results. Results sections do not include any interpretation of what results might mean, leaving that for the discussion. Figures are referenced parenthetically, and the written section appears before the figure it references. If results from statistical tests (like a t-test or ANOVA) were reported, they should be in parentheses as well.</p>
						<blockquote><image source="biology-results.png" width="100%"><description>A graph of average change in dissolved oxygen modeled on light intensity. Average change in dissolved oxygen increases rapidly and peaks at a light intensity of 80 micro-mols to the negative 2 per second to the negative one, after which it plateaus for remaining increases in light intensity.</description></image>
						<p><em>Figure 1</em> Increasing light intensity causes an increase in <taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon> photosynthetic activity up to 80 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m>.</p>

From light intensities of 10 to 30 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m> the average <m>\Delta\text{DO}</m> increased by 53%. From light intensities 30 to 50 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m> the average <m>\Delta\text{DO}</m> increased by 11%.

						<p>The details of good figure design are beyond the scope of this chapter, but a well-designed figure should clearly convey the important trends in the data. Looking at figures and figure captions is one of the first things people do when reading a scientific paper, so figure captions should include enough information that they make sense to someone who hasn’t read the rest of your results or methods. Make sure the caption states what important biological takeaways a reader should get from the figure. This means there will be some repetition: notice how this caption mentions some of the same things as the results without repeating them exactly. It also includes a quick overview of the methods used to produce these data. For a lab report with multiple figures, each caption should only reference methods and results pertaining to that figure. </p>

						<p>This results section presents results without interpretation. The text is used to present important results which may also be listed in figures or tables. In this example, the important results to emphasize are the ones that were used to identify the unknowns. Many projects in college chemistry involve identification or synthesis, so the results might not always translate to visually interesting graphs. However, if you draw out the important clues that lead to your conclusions, you can build dry numerical results into a compelling narrative. This results section is written in past tense passive voice, which is standard for chemistry.</p>
						<p>Detailed results are presented in tables. The tables should be numbered, have concise, unambiguous titles, and have clear column headings that include units when relevant. For table 2 in this example, units are included except for ‘gas’ and ‘reactivity with flame.’ When presenting lots of numerical results, be sure to use consistent and appropriate numbers of significant figures. Formal tables use only three horizontal lines and no vertical lines. While this example does not include a figure, figures should also be numbered sequentially and have short captions describing the data they present. Figure captions for chemistry are usually shorter than for biology and should describe but not interpret the figure. Captions for figures and tables often include information about how the data was collected, which is less common in biology. However, the figure and its caption should still be able to stand alone. Figures and tables should be referenced in the text of the results section, either directly (ie. <q>Table 2 summarizes the data measured and calculated about each unknown gas, as well as the results of their reaction with a flame</q> from the above example) or parenthetically (ie. <q>The mass of the sample of Unknown Gas 1 was found to be 0.4282g (Table 2).</q>). Check with your instructor for specifics of formatting and examples of figures and tables.</p>

					<title>Discussions</title>
					<p>The discussion synthesizes the findings of your experiment in the context of literature in the field. It should return to scientific concepts you introduced at the beginning of the lab report and clearly state how your results relate to them. The discussion should use the opposite structure of the introduction, beginning zoomed in on your specific results and then broadening in focus. It should clearly state how your results do or do not support your hypotheses. Then, it should zoom out and compare the results with current knowledge in the field. Be sure to compare the methods you used with other studies you examine. Don’t shy away from pointing out inconsistencies with other studies or potential errors in your work.</p>
					<p>For undergraduate classes and especially at the 100 or 200 level, discussions for biology lab reports are much more broad than those for chemistry. Biology lab reports usually require more comparisons to outside published literature, while chemistry lab reports may focus more on clearly interpreting the results of the experiment. Biology lab reports also put a heavier emphasis on what questions are raised by the research and important directions for future work.</p>
					<note><title>Conclusions</title><p>Some longer lab reports may also include a seperate conclusion, but this is unusual at the introductory level and not included here. The conclusion expresses the significance of your work, explaining how your results contribute to the field more broadly and potentially introducing ideas for further work. These same goals should be achieved in the closing paragraph of your discussion if a conclusion is not included.</p></note>

						<title>Discussion: Biology</title>
						<blockquote><p>The results of the experiment supported the hypothesis that as the light intensity increases the amount of dissolved oxygen would also increase. The results also support the idea of a light saturation point with the plateau seen on the graph. As light intensity increases it reaches a point where adding more light will not increase the rate of photosynthesis because the chloroplasts have reached their saturation point. The overlapping of the standard error bars of the last four light intensities shows that there is no significant difference between the numbers, and the peak represents the amount of light <taxon>E. canadensis</taxon> can use most efficiently, which is 80 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m>.</p>
						<p>Light saturation points have also been found in other studies on photosynthesis, mostly using photosynthetic algae. In the experiment referenced in the introduction, marine plankton algae were tested at different light intensities and had a saturation point after which more light no longer enhanced the rate of photosynthesis (John H Ryther, 1954). In addition, in a 1973 study Diner and Mauzerall measured photosynthesis in the algae <taxon>Chlorella vulgaris</taxon> and <taxon>Phormidium luridium</taxon>. Dissolved oxygen was measured in these algae after being tested in low light intensities and high light intensities using a repetitive-flash method. Both <taxon>Chlorella vulgaris</taxon> and <taxon>Phormidium luridum</taxon> reached similar saturation points around a light intensity of 180 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m>. The saturation point of the algae is notably higher than that of the tested <taxon>E. canadensis</taxon> at 80 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m>.  The algae may have evolved higher light saturation points so that they can take full advantage of the light they get because their habitat, water, can limit the amount of light they can absorb. The <taxon>E. canadensis</taxon> does need to have this ability because they grow out of the water, unlike algae that is always surrounded by water and sometimes grows deep underwater. This study concluded that the <taxon>C. vulgaris</taxon> and the <taxon>P. luridium</taxon> reached saturation points where they could no longer increase their rate of photosynthesis because there was too much light for chloroplasts of their size to absorb (B. Diner, D. Mauzerall).</p>
						<p>In order to address the importance of chloroplast size as a limiting factor for photosynthetic rate, another study investigated the potential of creating modified chloroplasts with continuous grana, the stack of thylakoid disks. Using the female thalli of <taxon>Marchantia polymorpha</taxon> grown on a petri dish the chloroplasts were isolated using a centrifuge at 2000 g for 1 minute. The chloroplasts were then modified and tested under very specific different light intensities. The saturation point was 43.2 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m> higher for modified chloroplasts, but a limit still existed (R Mache and S. Loiseaux, 1973). The experiment proved that there would always be a saturation threshold even with modified chloroplasts because larger chloroplasts still have a capacity limit and will regulate the photosynthetic rate. Further studies could compare chloroplast size and photosynthetic capacity between different kinds of photosynthetic organisms and seek to understand the evolutionary trade-offs of chloroplast size.</p></blockquote>
						<p>These three paragraphs explain one of the major results of the study, the existence of a light saturation point, and compare it to other published studies. The first paragraph makes it clear what the peak in dissolved oxygen production rate means. The second paragraph looks at two other studies that also found light saturation points. It’s important to include interpretation here. One strong statement in this example addresses the habitat difference between the study organisms, which could explain different values for light saturation. The third paragraph goes further by explaining a study that may help explain results observed in the lab. Finally, it presents ideas for further investigation in this direction.</p>
						<p>In a longer lab report, multiple significant findings should be explained and compared to studies in this way. Think about what larger interpretive claims this leads you to: do the patterns line up? If not, how could the differences be explained or investigated? What further questions do these results raise?</p>
						<blockquote><p>When plants were kept in the dark, dissolved oxygen decreased over the 90 minute trial period. These plants used oxygen to convert sugars into usable energy through cellular respiration (Campbell et al 2009).  In light independent settings the plant is required to use what is known as the Calvin cycle, where the plant converts carbon dioxide into glucose in the stroma, using what it had created from light dependent reactions to support itself through the light independent reaction (Campbell et al 2009). This process requires oxygen, explaining a loss in dissolved oxygen over time.</p></blockquote>
						<p>This paragraph addresses another result, the negative values for plants left in the dark. This interpretation is based on facts from the textbook. For a more advanced lab this result might also be compared to published studies, but because this phenomenon is universally understood and accepted it is appropriate to just quickly explain the science behind it here.</p>
						<blockquote><p>While patterns are clear, there was considerable variation between the three trials. This experiment did not control for temperature or time of day, which could have influenced the photosynthetic rate and created excess variation. The overall error is fairly minimal but does vary a lot with larger error bars at 140 and 200 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m> and small error bars at 30 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m>.</p></blockquote>
						<p>This paragraph addresses variables that were not controlled for by the experimental design. This is an important thing to address, and just saying <q>results may be due to human error</q> isn’t going to cut it in college. Think about any potential confounding variables. </p>
						<blockquote><p>This experiment supported existing literature on photosynthesis by showing that <taxon>Elodea canadensis</taxon> reaches peak photosynthetic efficiency around 80 <m>\mu\text{mol photons m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}</m>. Differences in photosynthetic efficiency between species may be explained by different chloroplast size, but their evolutionary purpose is not fully understood. Further research should be conducted to determine how photosynthetic efficiency and capacity are related to habitat.</p></blockquote>
						<p>The concluding paragraph of the discussion should remind the reader of the major results and their potential implications, which is especially important when the discussion is long enough that they might be overwhelmed. This last paragraph ties up what the author thinks is most important and shares a path forwards for this research. Thinking critically about what new research questions this work suggests is an important part of lab reports for biology!</p>

						<blockquote>
							<p><em>Determination of Unknown Gas 1</em></p>
							<p>By comparing the calculated molar mass of Unknown Gas 1 to the molar masses of the gases given in Table 1, it was hypothesized that Unknown Gas 1 was Argon gas (<m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m>). This was because the calculated molar mass of the unknown gas, 39.97601g/mol, was very close to Argon gas’s ideal molar mass of 39.948g/mol. However, because the experiment dealt with real gases in real conditions, and the values given in Table 1 are for ideal gases, it was conceded that it was possible Unknown Gas 1 might have been carbon dioxide gas (<m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m>), which has an ideal molar mass of 44.009g/mol. Because both <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m> and <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m> are inert gases, the results of the flame test only confirmed that it was one of the two. To distinguish between which gas it actually was, the limewater test was used. Limewater [<m>\text{Ca(OH)}_{2(aq)}</m>], when mixed with <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m>, forms a precipitate. The reaction for <m>\text{Ca(OH)}_{2(aq)}</m> mixed with <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m> is given by: <me>\text{CO}_{2(g)}+\text{Ca(OH)}_{2(aq)}→\text{CaCO}_{3(s)}+\text{H}_2\text{O}_{(l)}</me> Because the <m>\text{Ca(OH)}_{2}</m> formed a precipitate when it was added to the <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m>, Ar(g) was ruled out as a possibility, and it was concluded that the identity of Unknown Gas 1 was carbon dioxide, <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m>.</p>
							<p><em>Determination of Unknown Gas 2</em></p>
							<p>When the molar mass of Unknown Gas 2 was compared with the ideal gases’ molar masses in Table 1, it was hypothesized that the identity of Unknown Gas 2 was <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m>, with a possibility of it being oxygen (<m>\text{O}_{2(g)}</m>). Although <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m> was hypothesized to be Unknown Gas 1, it was proven to be <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m> instead, so <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m> was still a possibility (a term of the experiment was that none of the unknown gases would be the same as each other). Unknown Gas 2’s molar mass was found to be 35.9581g/mol, which is about equidistant between <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m>’s ideal molar mass (39.948g/mol) and <m>\text{O}_{2(g)}</m>’s molar mass (31.998g/mol). <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m> was selected as the more likely candidate because of the comparison between Unknown Gas 1 and <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m>’s molar masses. The calculated molar mass of the unknown gas ended up being roughly 4g/mol less than the ideal molar mass of <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m>. This is most likely because of the difference between actual and ideal gases (see Sources of Error). So, <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m> was more likely to be Unknown Gas 2 because its ideal molar mass is roughly 4g/mol more than the calculated molar mass of Unknown Gas 2. The actual identity of Unknown gas was confirmed with the flame test. If the gas had been <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m>, the inert reaction would have snuffed out the flaming matchstick. However, if the gas had been <m>\text{O}_{2(g)}</m>, which supports combustion, the gas inside the flask would have combusted. The flame test showed that Unknown Gas 2 was an inert gas, supporting the hypothesis that it was <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m>. To definitively confirm the gas’s identity and rule out <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m> as a possibility (despite the fact that <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m> had already been confirmed as the identity of Unknown Gas 1, and no gas could be used twice), the limewater test was applied to Unknown Gas 2. When the dropper of <m>\text{Ca(OH)}_2</m> was added to the flask and swirled, no precipitate formed, confirming that Unknown Gas 2 was Argon gas, or <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m>.</p>
							<p><em>Determination of Unknown Gas 3</em></p>
							<p>The experimental molar mass of Unknown Gas 3 (42.5765g/mol) was compared with the ideal molar masses of the gases given in Table 1, and from that it was hypothesized that Unknown Gas 3 was propane gas, or <m>\text{C}_3\text{H}_{8(g)}</m>. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that the first two unknown gases’ actual molar masses were consistently less than the gas they were identified as. So, because <m>\text{C}_3\text{H}_{8(g)}</m>’s ideal molar mass is 44.097g/mol and Unknown Gas 3’s experimental molar mass was 42.5765g/mol, <m>\text{C}_3\text{H}_{8(g)}</m> was likely to be the identity of Unknown Gas 3. The other possible identities of Unknown Gas 3 were <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m> and <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m>, because they had the ideal molar masses closest to Gas 3’s molar mass, but they were deemed unlikely to be the gas because they had both already been identified as Unknown Gases 1 and 2, respectively, and no gas would be used twice. The flame test for Unknown Gas 3 confirmed the hypothesis that Gas 3 was <m>\text{C}_3\text{H}_{8(g)}</m>. <m>\text{C}_3\text{H}_{8(g)}</m> supports combustion, and so if the gas had been <m>\text{C}_3\text{H}_{8(g)}</m> the gas inside the flask would have caught fire when exposed to a flaming matchstick. This is exactly what happened, and so definitively ruled out <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m> and <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m> from the list of possibilities, as both are inert gases and would have caused a flaming matchstick to be extinguished. So, Unknown Gas 3 was identified as propane gas, <m>\text{C}_3\text{H}_{8(g)}</m>.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>These three paragraphs walk the reader through an interpretation of the results for each unknown gas. Subheadings make for excellent organization. The author explicitly lays out how the data presented in the results leads to the conclusions drawn by the author. Take the last four sentences of Unknown Gas 3 as an example. First, the author asserts a conclusion: that the flame test confirmed the identity of the gas. Second, they pull in outside information supporting the conclusion, which is that <m>\text{C}_3\text{H}_{8(g)}</m> is combustible. Third, they describe the result, that the gas caught fire. Fourth, they bring in additional outside information (that <m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m> and <m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m> are inert) to confirm their conclusion. Finally, they re-assert the conclusion so it is clear to the reader.</p>
						<p>An important distinction from the biology example is the way outside information has been used. In the biology example, results are compared to similar published studies to look at larger trends. Here, the outside information used is molar mass and flammability information that is known for the gasses in question. These data are not cited because they are chemical facts drawn straight from the lab handout. While this lab teaches important chemical concepts and techniques, it is far from representing novel knowledge in the field, and drawing comparisons to contemporary chemical literature (or even literature from the 1970s) would be forced and inaccurate. Thus, the emphasis is much narrower: instead of demonstrating context in the field, the author just shows how they used their results to draw their conclusions. In higher-level chemistry classes where experiments are more novel, more outside literature will be required. However, discussions at an undergraduate level should still avoid the kind of broad statements that might occur in a biology paper.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p><em>Sources of Error</em></p>
							<p>While all the tests led to conclusive results, there was still the possibility of error during experimentation, which could have affected the values and qualities recorded. A possible source of error in the experiment is the equation used to calculate the molar mass of the unknown gases. The ideal gas law was used, which is given as: PV=nRT, or PV=gRTMW, Where P is the atmospheric pressure, V is the gas volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, g is the mass, and MW is the molar mass (also known as the molar weight). The ideal gas law assumes that the temperature and pressure are constant, and that no forces act upon the gases except for the negligible ones created by the gas atoms colliding momentarily. It is nearly impossible to ensure perfectly constant temperature and pressure, and to remove all external forces, so the calculated molar mass of the unknown gases could not have been equal to the ideal values given in Table 1. By possibly giving a molar mass value closer to the ideal value of a gas that was not the actual gas, the predictions of the identity of the unknown gases could have been less accurate. However, this source of error was compensated for. It was recognized that the calculated molar masses of the unknown gases were consistently less than the ideal molar masses, and so the predictions were based on the ideal gases with molar masses slightly larger than the experimental molar masses.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>The discussion is also a space to discuss potential sources of error in your experiment. This is most important if your results were inconsistent, like if your percent yield is very low or over 100% or (in this example) if flame test results and molar mass didn’t lead to one conclusive identification. If you are comparing to outside sources and your results disagree with the literature, it’s important to discuss what differences in methodology could have led to different results. Novel results can be valid, but should be assessed critically! In a college course, <q>human error</q> as an explanation is insufficient: be specific and thoughtful about what could have impacted your results.</p>
						<blockquote><p>The three gases identified in this experiment were carbon dioxide (<m>\text{CO}_{2(g)}</m>), argon (<m>\text{Ar}_{(g)}</m>), and propane (<m>\text{C}_3\text{H}_{8(g)}</m>). These three gases are fairly similar in that they are heavier and denser than air, yet all have their own unique properties that make them identifiable from each other. Carbon dioxide forms a precipitate when mixed with limewater, propane is combustible, and argon is a non-reactive inert gas. All of these gases are present in earth’s atmosphere naturally, though in mostly very small quantities. By isolating these gases and working with them individually, it was possible to examine their separate properties with negligible interference from the rest of the atmospheric gases</p></blockquote>
						<p>The closing paragraph summarizes the report by restating the most important results. Because this experiment is more about learning techniques and chemical properties than contributing to research, there’s less of an emphasis on future research than in the biology example. Ideas for future research become more significant in upper division Chemistry courses.</p>
