        <title>Acknowledgments</title>

        <p><pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> was launched in 2019 as a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike text, culminating several years' work toward a writing handbook that is as accessible as possible<mdash/>free of cost, screen-reader ready, and welcoming of the many identities that writers bring to their work. <custom ref="local-needs"/></p>
        <p><pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> is the product of communal efforts over more than a decade, and we have many people to acknowledge. Julie Neff-Lippman<mdash/>director of the Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching (<init>CWLT</init>) from 1984 until 2011<mdash/>laid the groundwork for this handbook, exploring the possibility of a Puget Sound writing handbook, working with writing advisors to develop many of the handouts still in use in the <init>CWLT</init>, and developing the culture of peer leadership in the <init>CWLT</init> that makes a project like this possible. Julie Nelson Christoph<mdash/>director of the <init>CWLT</init> 2012<ndash/>2018<mdash/>has further developed the project, leading a pilot of some commercial handbooks, one of which was chosen and customized as the first Puget Sound writing handbook, in use from 2012<ndash/>2017.</p>
        <p>In 2015, conversations on campus about linguistic diversity, about the special role of writing in a liberal arts context, and about the benefits of online and freely accessible books made us wonder: Could Puget Sound develop its own writing handbook? And if we could, who would write it? How long would it take to write? What would the platform look like?</p>
        <p>Supported by the leadership of Julie Nelson Christoph, Student Writing Advisors Kylie Young ('17, STS and SOAN major), Kieran O'Neil ('16, Biology major), and Cody Chun ('17, English major) took a chance in spring 2016 and applied for the somewhat nebulous job of being <q>Writing Handbook Developers.</q></p>
        <p>This handbook originated in conversations among the four authors<mdash/>over coffee in Seattle; about articles we read and scholarly lectures we attended on language and learning; in the comfy chairs in the Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching; over weekly transatlantic and transpacific Skype calls when our team was physically separated; and, always, through our abiding faith in the worth and importance of our project. Cody, Kieran, and Kylie composed the words you are about to read, using Julie as a sounding board, advisor, and editor through the process. The writers are grateful to Julie for her mentorship, her trust in us and our abilities, and her ever-inspiring guidance and gusto.</p>
        <p>As with any group project, part of the work has been identifying individual talents and coordinating efforts. We've been extremely fortunate in having a diverse range of interests and disciplinary backgrounds represented on the team. We've all learned a great deal about writing and collaboration from each other, and the team as a whole has coordinated efforts so that the project has progressed continuously, sometimes with the full team, sometimes with individual members stepping up and doing more when others were unable to do so. The collaborative process and support has been truly remarkable.</p>
        <p>Many, many thanks go to former Associate Dean Martin Jackson for supporting the project in countless ways from the very earliest moment; this has been a huge project to undertake, and your willingness to entertain the possibility, to find the funding, to bounce ideas, and even to pinch-hit as a programmer have been invaluable.</p>
        <p>Isabelle Anderson ('18, Chemistry and English major) was the first annual writing handbook developer and met with departments at Puget Sound to listen to faculty and develop many of the disciplinary writing guidelines that appear here. Sarah Walling-Bell ('20, Computer Science) accomplished significant revisions to the Writing with Awareness chapter, incorporating important contributions of student members of identity-based groups on our campus. Jordan Fonseca ('18, Physics and Mathematics) substantially revised the content on strategies for academic success and improved the consistency of coding throughout the handbook. Bethany Llewellyn ('21, Biology and Environmental Policy and Decision Making) has continued the work of keeping the handbook up to date and is largely responsible for the revisions to this edition that widen access to Sound Writing to users outside of Puget Sound; she's spent countless hours considering ways that we might, for instance, replace the Puget Sound-specific references to "Grizz" and "President Crawford" to more universally relevant terms. Kate True ('23, Communication Studies and Politics and Government) made additional revisions and added the Multilingual Writers section. We, the initial writers, are grateful for our successors' willingness to improve the book that has come to mean so much to us.</p>
        <p>Special thanks go to Rob Beezer for developing the fabulous <pretext/> (née MathBook XML) format and for taking a chance on a non-math project. Rob's technical expertise has enabled us to realize our initially vague desires to create a text that would be accessible in multiple senses of the word. Without Rob's collaboration, our hopes for the reach of our text could not have been developed to the extent they are here, and we look forward to our continued collaboration and to the new audiences that PreTeXt will facilitate.</p>
        <p>Thanks also to Jahrme Risner ('18, Math and Computer Science major) for inputting all those Google Docs into the PreTeXt format, fielding feedback in multiple platforms and from multiple people with aplomb. Cara Farnell, Bethany Llewellyn '21, and Rob Beezer have continued that work. We are grateful to Sarah Stall, Michaela Alden, and Julie Reynolds for helping us consider design options for the handbook and, especially, for Sarah's intensive work proofreading a near-final draft. Fletcher Crone '25 created the cover design.</p>
        <p>We would also like to thank Geoffrey Block, Bill Breitenbach, Gwynne Brown, Kris Imbrigotta, Chris Kendall, Kriszta Kotsis, and Amy Spivey for making the time to be interviewed about writing, writing process, and advice to student writers. We also thank the departments who have shared faculty meeting time with us to develop discipline-specific writing guidelines and the student groups who have given generously of their time and experiences to develop the Writing With Awareness chapter. Thank you, as well, to Fallon Boyle, Bill Breitenbach, Nancy Bristow, Bev Conner, George Erving, Will Gent, Dexter Gordon, Priti Joshi, Pierre Ly, Julie Neff-Lippman, Helen Shears, Ariela Tubert, and Kara Widergren for their assistance with the example student papers and writing prompts. Thank you to Rachael Shelden of the CWLT for her guidance on student success strategies and to the many student writing advisors who have shared this book with classes at Puget Sound and have strengthened the ongoing feedback loop with our readers. As always, thank you to Peggy Burge, Jane Carlin, and everyone at Collins Memorial Library for your collaboration. And thank you to the many Puget Sound students and faculty who have responded to surveys and participated in focus groups and discussions that have shaped this book.</p>
        <p>Perhaps our greatest thanks are to you, our users! Thank you for using the Puget Sound writing handbook. We hope you will enjoy using it and that it will inspire you<mdash/>as it has us<mdash/>to think critically about language, to talk with each other about writing, and to engage in the communal effort that is at the heart of scholarship. <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> is a living document and will continue to be revised online; please collaborate by sending your comments and suggestions to <url href="mailto:soundwriting@pugetsound.edu"><c>soundwriting@pugetsound.edu</c></url>.</p>

        <title>Preface</title>
        <p>Whether you are reading this for class or browsing<mdash/>whether you are working on an essay for your <custom ref="intro-writing"/> or drafting your comparative politics thesis<mdash/>whether you love writing or consider it a chore<mdash/><pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> is for you.</p>
        <p>The purpose of <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> is to help you develop a range of techniques that you can use to succeed as an academic writer. As you'll soon discover (if you have not discovered already), academic writing is a practice with its own conventions and expectations. Academic inquiry is about using the best possible evidence to grapple with contested issues. Academic writing places special emphasis on rigorous use of evidence to substantiate claims, on clear and specific theses, and on the framing of arguments within scholarly contexts. These traits distinguish academic writing from most popular writing (the type of writing that one finds on blogs, in newspapers and magazines, and on Facebook). Though it is possible to discuss <q>academic writing</q> as a coherent entity, academic writing is also diverse and reflects writers' own personal, disciplinary, and sub-disciplinary biases. (Take a look at the example student essays included in the Resources section of this book.) In <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle>, we hope to provide you with the essentials of university writing so that you can write with as little stress and as much success as possible. Inside this book, you'll find a breakdown of research, composition, and revision processes; strategies for overcoming common writing challenges; advice from faculty members; a guide to <init>APA</init>-, Chicago-, and <init>MLA</init>-style citations; and much more.</p>
        <p>Though <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle> offers advice and tips, we write in hopes that you will consider how this advice resonates in your particular context and that you will use the advice not as rules to follow blindly but as material that enables you to make informed choices. Our work is guided by the belief that language evolves and reflects, in its evolution, both socio-political change and cultural particularity. The very language that you use when you engage in academic inquiry embodies choices, as well as the history of choices and events that led to the moment of your writing.</p>
        <p>As intentional writers, ourselves, we have made choices that you may find surprising, troublesome, or just plain wrong. For instance, we have chosen in many places to use <q>they</q> as a singular pronoun (see <xref ref="singular-they" text="title"/>). Much as we'd like to think that we're in the forefront of thinking about language change, we're not being particularly radical. Unlike other alternative pronouns<mdash/><url href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/third-person-gender-neutral-pronoun-thon">like <q>hiser</q> and <q>thon</q></url><mdash/><q>they</q> has been used in this way for centuries. Following suit with the <url href="https://blog.ap.org/products-and-services/making-a-case-for-a-singular-they">2017 AP Style guide</url>, we use <q>they</q> in many places where no gender is specified, or where a named person might not use <q>his</q> or <q>her</q> pronouns. In other places in the text, we acknowledge that language can marginalize, traumatize, and oppress, and we suggest alternatives to sexist, LGBTQ+-phobic, racist, classist, and ableist terminologies of oppression. </p>
        <p>One aspect of academic writing that we grappled with as we wrote this guide is the notion of a <q><xref ref="SAE" text="title"/></q> (<init>SAE</init>). Although <init>SAE</init> is by no means the only <q>correct</q> form of English, it has a privileged status in the academy and in our society as a whole, and it can be an important tool for social mobility. We recognize this fact at the same time that we work against its implications. Throughout <pubtitle>Sound Writing</pubtitle>, we call attention to aspects of <init>SAE</init> that are especially contested, and we recognize from time to time that alternatives exist.</p>
        <p><custom ref="goals"/>We hope you will find it useful, and that you'll help make it even better by emailing your suggestions to <url href="mailto:soundwriting@pugetsound.edu"><c>soundwriting@pugetsound.edu</c></url>.</p>

        <title>Overview</title>
        <p>In order to make this <em>Sound Writing</em> handbook as easy to use and as accessible as possible, we've broken it into twelve chapters, each one focusing on a different aspect of the research and writing process. Clicking on a chapter title in the Table of Contents will take you to that chapter, which means you no longer need to flip through pages to find what you're looking for!</p>
        <p><xref ref="research-methods" text="type-global"/> and <xref ref="how-to-read" text="type-global"/> suggest techniques for researching, reading source material, and taking notes. This is a good place to start if you have an assignment prompt and want some advice on finding, reading, or analyzing sources.</p>
        <p><xref ref="forming-your-argument" text="type-global"/> breaks down the basic parts of the argument, helps you to identify which argumentation style(s) to use, offers tips for making a strong argument, and covers how to develop, organize, and support your thesis.</p>
        <p><xref ref="the-writing-process" text="type-global"/> offers brainstorming techniques, planning strategies, and outlining formats to get your scholarly gears turning. It also breaks down the skeleton of the paper, offering tips on how to compose and organize introductions, topic sentences, body paragraphs, and conclusions. Writing is not a linear process, so you'll likely still be conducting research and changing your argument as you go; to maintain your groove, refer to the sections on revising and adding new research. And if you find that you just can't write any longer, take a look at the section on overcoming writer's block and other obstacles for ideas on how to overcome anxiety and frustration, manage your time, and procrastinate (yes, procrastinate!) productively.</p>
        <p>In <xref ref="discipline-specific-writing" text="type-global"/>, <custom ref="chapter-five"/></p>
        <p><xref ref="writing-with-awareness" text="type-global"/> suggests ways to write with greater sensitivity to the social ramifications of certain English usages. We include a list of terminologies of oppression for the respectful writer to avoid and a list of possible alternatives.</p>
        <p><xref ref="writing-sentence-level" text="type-global"/> and <xref ref="citations" text="type-global"/> focus on the nitty-gritty, but necessary, elements of language, offering grammatical and mechanical advice and examples of how to cite your sources in keeping with the APA, Chicago, and MLA styles.</p>
        <p><xref ref="speaking" text="type-global"/> considers the relationship between writing and speaking, and offers advice on how to convert your written argument into an oral argument. This chapter also includes suggestions for effective public speaking, for organizing your presentation, and for managing your time.</p>
        <p><xref ref="academic-success" text="type-global"/> marks the shift in the handbook from topics that fit squarely into reading and writing to topics about academic success more broadly. The chapter breaks into three main sections: talking to professors, managing time, and organizing your physical and digital materials.  The strategies discussed are not the be-all-and-end-all of any of these topics; however, they give the reader a foundation of <q>best practices</q> for getting started.</p>
        <p><xref ref="different-writing-genres" text="type-global"/> extends beyond academic writing to offer advice on writing tricky non-academic genres like emails to professors and employers, personal statements, and resumes and cover letters. Those non-academic genres are mostly short, but they're every bit as challenging to write well as a long research paper is. Don't worry; we've got your back.</p>
        <p><xref ref="using-technology" text="type-global"/> offers tips and tricks for using technology to help you as a writer, including how to get the most out of your word processing program, how to use Zotero to help you wrangle sources and citations, and how to use tools within Adobe Acrobat Reader to help you read and annotate pdf documents.</p>
        <p><xref ref="glossary" text="type-global"/> (<xref ref="glossary" text="title"/>) offers definitions of some of the new vocabulary you will be encountering in college<mdash/>ranging from words you may see in assignments, to terminology associated with various research terms and kinds of sources, to rhetorical terms, to SAT-type words that you really will encounter in everyday usage.</p>
        <p><xref ref="resources" text="type-global"/> (<xref ref="resources" text="title"/>) offers links to supplementary aids such as videos, handouts, and example papers. These resources will help you make the best use of the handbook, whether you are using it in class as part of an exercise, or using it on your own for independent learning.</p>
