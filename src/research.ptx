        <title>Research Essentials</title>
        <p>The word <q>research</q> can seem daunting, but doing independent research can be some of the most exciting work you'll do in college.</p>
        <p><url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/collins-memorial-library/">Collins Library</url> provides access to rich collections, engaging learning environments, innovative instruction, and high-quality service in support of the university's mission of teaching, learning, civic engagement, and diversity. We encourage you to familiarize yourself early on with the scope of materials and the types of services available to you in an academic library, as they may differ markedly from those available in most school and public libraries. Collins Library works in close partnership with the faculty and other campus departments to support your development as a scholar.</p>
        <p>Knowing that Collins Library is there to help you is the first step, but you'll also need to get going on your own. Here are some guidelines that will help you not only do research successfully but enjoy doing it.</p>
        <insight>
            <p>The first thing to know is that Collins Memorial Library is a university library and is probably a bit different than other libraries you've encountered in the past. This is because it's designed for people like yourself who are doing research, more than for people who are looking for a book to read or a movie to watch at home (though Collins Library has those things, too!).</p>

            <title>Strategies for Undertaking Research:</title>
            <ul>
                <li><title>Pick a topic that interests you</title>
                    <p>
                        Many times, there will be a topic that your professor has talked about a lot in class. Some of these topics may be straight forward and obvious, while others might seem more obscure and difficult to tackle but more interesting to you. Always choose the one you're most interested in. No matter how easy a project seems to be from the beginning, if it doesn't interest you, the research process will feel slow and painful. If, instead, you choose a topic that actually grabs your attention, the process of sifting through and evaluating dozens of articles and books won't feel tedious at all, and you'll have more energy to devote to thinking and rethinking your research question.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><title>Find the right search tools</title>
                    <p>
                        Primo<mdash/>the search engine that shows up first when you click on the <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/collins-memorial-library/">Collins Library website</url><mdash/>may seem like it has every source you could possibly need. While Primo can be very helpful, there are more than 200 other databases to which the library provides access. Each of these databases is specifically catered to a particular topic (or topics), which means that you won't find as many unrelated articles as you would in Primo. For the same reason, you may also find sources more pertinent to your research topic by using more specific databases. To figure out which database you need, try checking out <url href="https://research.pugetsound.edu/?b=t">research and course guides</url><fn><c>research.pugetsound.edu</c></fn>. If you're undertaking interdisciplinary research, you'll likely want to search more than one database.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><title>Use your library course or subject guide</title>
                    <p>
                        The <url href="https://research.pugetsound.edu/?b=s">research and subject guides</url><fn><c>research.pugetsound.edu</c></fn> are created by the research librarians for you to use. They have a lot of great information that can be very helpful for you in your research process. For instance, they can help you figure out whether your source is scholarly or popular, and whether it's primary, secondary, or tertiary. They also can point you to which databases you should be using and give you tips on how to use them. If you get stuck in your process, the course guides also have the contact information of the liaison librarian working with your class, as well as that of the <url href="http://research.pugetsound.edu/peerresearch">peer research advisor</url>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><title>Get help</title>
                    <p>
                        There are people whose job it is to help you make the best out of your research paper<mdash/>use them! The <url href="http://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/collins-memorial-library/services/borrowing/student-manual/learningcommons">liaison librarians</url> and <url href="http://research.pugetsound.edu/peerresearch">peer research advisor</url> love when students ask them for help. All of their contact information is available on the <url href="http://library.pugetsound.edu">library website</url>, so you can call or email them to make an appointment or ask a question. The <url href="http://research.pugetsound.edu/peerresearch">peer research advisor</url> also has drop-in hours in the library after normal business hours, so you can still get help later in the evening. In addition, Collins Library participates in a <url href="http://www.questionpoint.org/crs/servlet/org.oclc.admin.BuildForm?&amp;page=frame&amp;institution=13202&amp;type=2&amp;language=1">24/7 chat service</url> that is staffed by librarians around the world. Whether you're just starting to think of a topic or nearing the end of your process, the librarians and peer research advisor can get you the help you need.

                <li><title>Start early</title>
                    <p>
                        You never know exactly how long your research project is going to take, but chances are it's going to take a lot longer than you think. The first sources you find won't always be the most helpful, so it's important to take your time with the search. Also, your question will change from when you first begin, so make sure you allow yourself enough time to get that second or third round of research done, as well. And don't forget about <xref ref="warning-research-fulfillment-time"/>!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><title>Don't give up</title>
                    <p>
                        Research can be a long process. Finding the best sources for your project can take weeks, months, or even a full semester! Sometimes, you will hit a roadblock and then feel like you have to go all the way back to square one. That's okay, because research is meant to be a cyclical process (see <xref ref="research-process-while-writing"/>). Even when it feels like you are starting over, you are still learning more and more about your topic, which will result in a very well-researched final paper!

            <p>If you find a really great book through <acro>SUMMIT</acro> or ILLiad, remember that it can take up to ten business days to get to you, so it's important to account for that in your timeline.</p>

            <title>Organizing and Analyzing Sources</title>
            <p>Research is a creative, recursive process, and it's likely that you'll encounter dozens of potentially relevant sources. It's easy to get overwhelmed, but here are two surefire strategies for handling information overload:</p>
            <p>Consider learning how to use a knowledge-management tool. Collins Library supports RefWorks and <xref ref="zotero"/>, and any librarian would be more than happy to help you get started. These tools do so much more than just format citations; they let you organize and reorganize your sources as your research question develops, and they support extensive note-taking.</p>
            <p>Your research assignment prompt likely will indicate what kinds of (and often how many) sources you should aim for. But a source is not a source is not a source! <em>How</em> are you using sources? Take things one step further by analyzing precisely how you will use each source when building your argument so that you're able to use your sources in the most appropriate way. One helpful framework is <url href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07350190701738858">Joseph Bizup's <acro>BEAM</acro> model</url>. <acro>BEAM</acro> is an acronym intended to help us think about the various ways we <em>use</em> sources when writing a researched argument. Understanding how you're using a source is essential to using it correctly and effectively.</p>

            <conclusion>
                <p>Though writing in high school consists mostly of <q>background</q> sources, most research writing that you do in college will be stronger if you use sources in a combination of most or all of these ways.</p>

        <title>Research Questions</title>
        <p>Once you've identified and explored your research topic, you'll need to work on refining your research question. A strong research question will allow you to delve into a genuine problem or question to which an answer is not obvious. In other words, you want a question that is debatable and arguable. In creating your own argument to answer the research question, you will use evidence from your research to acknowledge and refute any counter-evidence that you encounter.</p>

            <title>Strategies for Finding a Research Question</title>
            <ol>
                <li><title>Begin by asking as many open-ended <q>why?</q> or <q>how?</q> questions as you can think of</title>
                    <p>Your topic should be rich enough to generate at least three potential research questions. If you have difficulty generating more than one research question, it's likely that you need to include another variable or otherwise broaden the scope of your inquiry. An excellent guide to getting from a topic to a question can be found in Chapter 3 of <pubtitle>The Craft of Research</pubtitle>, available as an ebook in Primo to members of the University of Puget Sound community.</p>

                    <p>As you continue the research and writing processes, you may discover that your question is too broad or too narrow, or that there's another, related research question that your evidence is suggesting.</p>
                </li>
                <li><title>Hold off on deciding what your thesis is until you've identified a viable research question and have begun to delve into your research sources</title>
                    <p>Committing to a thesis prematurely can hamper your research process by causing you only to seek evidence that supports your argument.</p>

                        Sometimes you may find that a database search of your topic returns few to no results. Before giving up, try using different combinations of search terms. Sometimes the terms that make sense to you may not be quite the same as the ones scholars before you have used. If you're really stuck, using a thesaurus to find synonyms can be a helpful trick. Some databases make use of specialized subject terms, too, so this is another place where a librarian can really help out.
