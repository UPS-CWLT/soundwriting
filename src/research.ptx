        <title>Essentials</title>
        <p>The word <q>research</q> can seem daunting, but doing independent research can be some of the most exciting work you'll do in college.</p>
        <assemblage>
            <p>The first thing to know is that Collins Memorial Library is a university library and is probably a bit different than other libraries you've encountered in the past. This is because it's designed for people like yourself who are doing research, more than for people who are looking for a book to read or a movie to watch at home (though Collins Library has those things, too!).</p>
        </assemblage>
        <p>Collins Library provides access to rich collections, engaging learning environments, innovative instruction, and high quality service in support of the university's mission of teaching, learning, civic engagement and diversity. We encourage you to familiarize yourself early on with the scope of materials and the types of services available to you in an academic library, as they may differ markedly from those available in most school and public libraries. Collins Library works in close partnership with faculty and other campus departments to support your development as a scholar.</p>
        <p>Knowing that Collins Library is there to help you is the first step, but you'll also need to get going on your own. Here are some guidelines that will help you not only do research successfully but enjoy doing it.</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Pick a topic that interests you</title>
            <p>Many times, there will be a topic that your professor has talked about a lot in class. Some of these topics may be straight-forward and obvious, while others might seem more obscure and difficult to tackle but more interesting to you. Always choose the one you're most interested in. No matter how easy a project seems to be from the beginning, if it doesn't interest you the research process will feel slow and painful. If, instead, you choose a topic that actually grabs your attention, the process of sifting through and evaluating dozens of articles and books won't feel tedious at all and you'll have more energy to devote to thinking and rethinking your research question.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Find the right search tools</title>
            <p>Primo<mdash/>the search engine that shows up first when you click on the Collins Library page<mdash/>may seem like it has every source you could possibly need. While Primo can be very helpful, there are over 200 other databases to which the library provides access. Each of these databases is specifically catered to a particular topic (or topics), which means that you won't find as many unrelated articles as you would in Primo. For the same reason, you may also find sources more pertinent to your research topic by using more specific databases. To figure out which database you need, try checking out a library course or subject guide. If you're undertaking interdisciplinary research, you'll likely want to search more than one database.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Use your library course or subject guide</title>
            <p>The <url href="http://research.pugetsound.edu/index.php?gid=4657">course and subject guides</url> are created by the research librarians for you to use. They have a lot of great information that can be very helpful for you in your research process. For instance, they can help you figure out whether your source is scholarly or popular, and whether it's primary, secondary or tertiary. They can also point you to which databases you should be using and give you tips on how to use them. If you get stuck in your process, the course guides also have the contact information of the <url href="http://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/collins-memorial-library/services/borrowing/student-manual/learningcommons">Liaison Librarian</url> working with your class, as well as that of the <url href="http://research.pugetsound.edu/peerresearch">Peer Research Advisor</url>.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Get help</title>
            <p>There are people whose job it is to help you make the best out of your research paper<mdash/>use them! The <url href="http://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/collins-memorial-library/services/borrowing/student-manual/learningcommons">Liaison Librarians</url> and <url href="http://research.pugetsound.edu/peerresearch">Peer Research Advisor</url> love when students ask them for help. All of their contact information is available on the library website, so you can call or email them to make an appointment or ask a question. The <url href="http://research.pugetsound.edu/peerresearch">Peer Research Advisor</url> also has drop-in hours in the library after normal business hours, so you can still get help later on in the evening. In addition, Collins Library participates in a 24/7 chat service that is staffed by librarians around the world. Whether you're just starting to think of a topic or nearing the end of your process, the librarians and <url href="http://research.pugetsound.edu/peerresearch">Peer Research Advisor</url> can get you the help you need.</p>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Start early</title>
            <p>You never know exactly how long your research project is going to take, but chances are it's going to take a lot longer than you think. The first sources you find won't always be the most helpful, so it's important to take your time with the search. Also, your question will change from when you first begin, so make sure you allow yourself enough time to get that second or third round of research done as well. If you find a really great book through SUMMIT or ILLiad, remember that it can take up to ten business days to get to you, so it's important to account for that in your timeline.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Don't give up</title>
            <p>Research can be a long process. Finding the best sources for your project can take weeks, months, or even a full semester! Sometimes, you will hit a roadblock and then feel like you have to go all the way back to square one. That's okay, because research is meant to be a cyclical process (see <xref ref="research-process-while-writing" text="type-global"/>). Even when it feels like you are starting over, you are still learning more and more about your topic, which will result in a very well-researched final paper!</p>

            <title>Handling information overload</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>Research is a creative, recursive process and it's likely that you'll encounter dozens of potentially relevant sources. It's easy to get overwhelmed, but here are two surefire strategies for handling information overload:</p>
            </introduction>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Consider learning how to use a knowledge management tool. Collins Library supports RefWorks and Zotero, and any librarian would be more than happy to help you get started. These tools do so much more than just format citations; they let you organize and reorganize your sources as your research question develops, and they support extensive note-taking.</p></li>
                <li><p>Your research assignment prompt likely will indicate what kinds of (and often how many) sources you should aim for. But a source is not a source is not a source! <em>How</em> are you using sources? Take things one step further by analyzing precisely how you will use each source when building your argument so that you're able to use your sources in the most appropriate way. One helpful framework is <url href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07350190701738858">Joseph Bizup's <acro>BEAM</acro> model</url>. <acro>BEAM</acro> is an acronym intended to help us think about the various ways we <em>use</em> sources when writing a researched argument.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </list>
        <list>
            <dl>
                <li>
                    <title><em>B</em>ackground</title>
                    <p>You use tertiary sources (subject encyclopedias, textbooks, overviews) to establish basic facts and definitions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title><em>E</em>xhibit</title>
                    <p>You analyze and interpret primary sources, a dataset, or another phenomenon of study.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title><em>A</em>rgument</title>
                    <p>You evaluate and assess the arguments in academic secondary sources as a way to join the scholarly conversation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title><em>M</em>ethod</title>
                    <p>You use theories or disciplinary approaches when examining your topic.</p>
                </li>
            </dl>
            <conclusion>
                <p>Though writing in high school consists mostly of <q>Background</q> sources, most research writing that you do in college will be stronger if you use sources in a combination of most or all of these ways.</p>

        <title>Defining and Refining Your Research Question</title>
        <p>Once you've identified and explored your research topic, you'll need to work on refining your research question. A strong research question will allow you to delve into a genuine problem or question to which an answer is not obvious. In other words, you want a question that is debatable and arguable. In creating your own argument to answer the research question, you will use evidence from your research and acknowledge and refute any counter-evidence that you encounter.</p>
        <list>
            <title>Characteristics of Strong Research Questions</title>
            <ul>
                <li><p>typically ask <q>why?</q> or <q>how?</q> questions</p></li>
                <li><p>have a clear focus</p></li>
                <li><p>are feasible to answer with the resources and time available to you</p></li>
                <li><p>are calibrated in scope to the required length of the writing assignment</p></li>
                <li><p>are of interest or significance to others</p></li>
            </ul>
        </list>
        <list>
            <title>Key Steps</title>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Begin by asking as many open-ended <q>why?</q> or <q>how?</q> questions as you can think of. Your topic should be rich enough to generate at least three potential research questions. If you have difficulty generating more than one research question, it's likely that you need to include another variable or otherwise broaden the scope of your inquiry. An excellent guide to getting from a topic to a question can be found in Part II of <em>The Craft of Research</em>, available online via Collins Library to members of the University of Puget Sound community.</p></li>
                <li><p>Begin to evaluate your research questions. Which question interests you the most? Why?</p></li>
                <li><p>Seek out feedback from:<dl>
                    <li>
                        <title>Your peers</title>
                        <p>will give you a ready sense of whether or not your question is clear and interesting.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Peer writing advisors</title>
                        <p>will ask you lots of clarifying questions and help you develop the best possible formulation of your research question.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Librarians</title>
                        <p>will help you explore potential resources for tackling your research question and also will give you honest advice about the feasibility of your focus and project.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Your professors</title>
                        <p>are subject experts and are excellent resources for helping you identify where your question fits in the ongoing scholarly conversation.</p>
                    </li>
                </dl></p></li>
                <li><p>Be open to refining your research question. As you continue the research and writing process, you may discover that your question is too broad or too narrow, or that there's another, related research question that your evidence is suggesting.</p></li>
                <li><p>Hold off on deciding what your thesis is until you've identified a viable research question and have begun to delve into your research sources. Committing to a thesis prematurely can hamper your research process by causing you to only seek evidence that supports your argument.</p></li>

        <title>Tips and Tricks</title>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Check the works cited or bibliography of a scholarly source</title>
            <p>You may struggle to find more than a few sources that perfectly suit your topic; in such a case, look at the references that those sources cite. There's good chance you'll find other articles that can help you get back on track.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="search-terms">
            <title>Refine your search terms</title>
            <p>Every so often you will be searching databases for your topic and your search will return few to no results. Before giving up, try using different combinations of search terms. Sometimes the terms that make sense to you may not be quite the same as the ones scholars before you have used. If you're really stuck, using a thesaurus to find synonyms can be a helpful trick. Some databases make use of specialized subject terms, too, so this is another place where a librarian can really help out.</p>

            <title>Learn some handy tricks for searching databases</title>
            <p>
                Use an asterisk <c>*</c> at the end of a word (or root of a word) or to replace a letter within a word:
                <ul>
                    <li><p><c>Wom*n</c> will tell the database to search for both <q>women</q> and <q>woman.</q></p></li>
                    <li><p><c>Canad*</c> will tell the database to search for <q>Canada</q> and <q>Canadian.</q></p></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Put phrases in quotation marks so that the database knows to search for that exact phrase<mdash/><c>"information literacy"</c> instead of <c>information literacy</c>.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <list>
            <title>Make full use of Boolean operators</title>
            <dl>
                <li>
                    <title><c>OR</c></title>
                    <p>will expand your search to look for more than one keyword: cars <c>OR</c> autos <c>OR</c> automobiles will find sources that contain any one of these keywords.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title><c>AND</c></title>
                    <p>will limit your search to only those sources that contain both keywords: racism <c>AND</c> slavery will identify sources that include both keywords.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title><c>NOT</c></title>
                    <p>will exclude sources that contain that keyword.</p>
