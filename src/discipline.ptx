    <title>Discipline-Specific Writing</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>In the previous chapters, we have discussed general traits of all (or most?) academic writing and all academic writing processes. But, as you will no doubt notice, there are some significant differences between writing in different disciplines. It may sometimes seem like faculty members just want you to keep changing your writing to fit their individual preferences. While we all have our own preferences, faculty members also are trained specialists within their own disciplinary backgrounds, and part of their job is to teach you about those disciplinary backgrounds<mdash/>including the writing conventions of those disciplines.</p>
        <p>To help you navigate the discipline-specific writing conventions you encounter in your courses, we have consulted with faculty in departments at the University of Puget Sound. Based on our conversations with them, we have compiled the following guidelines. Try using these guidelines when you write your next paper; you may find that that seemingly quirky assignment makes more sense than you initially thought!</p>

        <title>Writing for African American Studies</title>
        <p>African American Studies (<init>AFAM</init>) is a discipline that you probably didn't encounter in high school, and hopefully you're excited about how much you have to learn. Read this guide to understand the basics of writing in <init>AFAM</init>!</p>
        <note>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, all italicized quotes throughout this section are excerpted from the interview with <init>AFAM</init> faculty members at the University of Puget Sound that informed this section.</p>
        </note>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p><q><em>Without writing it's hard for students to even learn and process what they're getting from AFAM, because it's so much, but if you start to write it, you can really start to gather your thoughts—what you do know, what you don't know, rather than just being able to shake your head agree, or even give a couple comments randomly in class. When you're trying to put it on paper you see the fact that, most likely it's a lot bigger than you thought.</em></q></p>
            <p>Distinct from other disciplines, AFAM is a deeply introspective, interdisciplinary, civically engaged and explicitly ethical field. Accordingly, the purpose of <init>AFAM</init> is to shape and strengthen your ethical convictions through informed research and writing. Thus, writing in AFAM is a practice that intentionally gives you a space to reflect more deeply on the bigger pictures of the discipline—to see what you didn't see before, to see your mind out loud. Therefore, even as AFAM shapes you into a better writer, it can also reveal to you how you've been taught to think by society and other disciplines, and encourage you to reflect on those teachings. This introspective quality of AFAM makes it uniquely interdisciplinary, allowing it to take on the absences, the unaddressed issues and unanswered questions of other disciplines. Lastly, AFAM will also push you outside yourself and into the experiences of others and into the civic sphere that the discipline itself is engaged in.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Traits and Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>You have to ask <sq>where we should have been in history?</sq> Because people of color are missing, that's why we cover all the disciplines, to ask <sq>where are we?</sq> So, really, every discipline is a part of Black Studies.</em></q></p>
            <p>At the heart of <init>AFAM</init> is an interdisciplinary formation. At its beginnings AFAM took on the absences of all the other disciplines, the places in them where should people of color have been. Accordingly, <init>AFAM</init> asks you to write conscious of the other disciplines you're writing in, not by being obedient to those disciplines, but by being aware that all disciplines have particular modes and methods of thinking and that they understand evidence differently—in a way that isn't necessarily objective. For instance, if you're citing an anthropologist on a particular topic, part of your analysis needs to include context like <q>What does an anthropologist tend to see and not see?</q> and <q>What is it that the field says?</q></p>
            <p>Another of <init>AFAM</init>'s values is the importance of understanding both sides of an argument and where both sides are coming from. It's an ethic of respect and regard to ask, before you get to <q>I disagree</q> and <q>I'm arguing this,</q> whether you know what the actual argument you're opposing is. This ethic of respect also extends backwards within the field itself: ideas have a long trajectory, and we tend to quote only the recent works. For example, we tend to give the prison industrial complex and the new Jim Crow conversations to Michelle Alexander, and that affects the erasure of Angela Davis. So when you're building an argument, you have to ask where the idea came from, because that's part of the battle against erasure. Further, this battle is an intersectional one, within the field, across gender, sexuality and class. Even within Black Studies there are ways in which certain writings get privileged and others don't, so the writing in this field strives not to practice the same erasure that other fields have practiced.</p>
            <p>A third characteristic of writing in <init>AFAM</init> is its civic engagement. Scholarship in AFAM is meant to reach out beyond practitioners of the field to people who aren't necessarily trained in sociology or history: if someone were to pick up your paper anywhere, they should be able to know what it's about quickly and efficiently. Although your professor likely already knows or has explained in class the definitions and the context of what you're writing about, at the end of the day, a lot of people don't know, and that's who you're writing to. Consequently, you have to make sure there's a foundation within your own writing that sets up for what you're sharing. You always have that platform you kick off of.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p><q><em>The idea that knowledge can come from outside of the academy is really central to Black Feminist thought.</em></q></p>
            <p>Unlike in many other disciplines, the lived experience and identity of the author are very important in <init>AFAM</init>. It would be difficult, in this field, to dismiss the personal because <init>AFAM</init> doesn’t exist without questioning knowledge production, without noting that knowledge is <em>not</em> objective and that Eurocentric disciplinary knowledge comes out of a particular time and place. So acknowledgment of personal perspectives or identity or position is a part of how this field understands knowledge constructions. Indeed, <init>AFAM</init> literally began with personal experience, with slave narratives. Some of our first historical information about Black folks is from those stories, and it’s in them that we first start to get a glimpse of what society was like for African Americans and other marginalized groups. Those narratives, written from an African American perspective, are the only way that some original truth or experience can be found. Even if you’re not African American or Black and you’re in this field, you still can’t erase the personal because that identity situates you.</p>
            <p>You do have to be careful with personal experience, though. Any evidence you bring forward must be part of a larger conversation, not something that only relates to you.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Conventions and Tips</title>
            <p><q><em>It’s not about political correctness or censorship. It’s care. Historically situated care. It’s not that you didn’t use the politically correct thing, it’s that you didn’t use the contextually careful thing, the ethically careful thing. The only way to write ethically is to practice.</em></q></p>
            <p><ul>
                <li><p>Language is important. Be very specific about the language you use throughout your writing; here are a couple of specific guidelines:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Capitalize <q>African American Studies,</q> and it's singular not plural.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Use current, appropriate language in your writing. Language used in the past to identify people of color is usually not appropriate in the current context unless you are citing a quote. (see <xref ref="writing-with-awareness"/> for more help on this, and if you’re still not sure, ask your professor).</p></li>
                    </ul></p></li>
                <li><p>Understand and convey the situatedness of whatever you write about. For instance, if you're writing about DuBois, you've got to explain why DuBois was arguing the way he was (in opposition to Booker T. Washington).</p></li>
                <li><p>Integrating language and quotes from Non-<init>SAE</init> speakers is encouraged. Use your writing as a space to include different voices. For instance, in an upper level <init>AFAM</init> class you might write a scientific counseling article about drug addiction but you could have direct excerpts about people's experiences with drug addiction as African Americans related to whatever section you’re talking about because that adds to it (see <xref ref="SAE"/>).</p></li>
                <li><p>Define your terms! You can't assume that everybody knows what you mean. Also sometimes there are many words for the same definition. You need to explain that when you say <q>Black,</q> you mean this vs. when you say <q>African American</q> you mean that.</p></li>
                <li><p>Don't rely on jargon! Your writing should be a way you can express what you're learning in class to the public. Jargon can get in the way.</p></li>
                <li><p>Come to class and do the reading so that you're prepared to write respectfully.</p></li>
            </ul></p>

        <title>Writing for Art and Art History</title>
        <p>Writing about art can be challenging because, before embarking on a discussion or analysis of a work, you first have to translate your experience of a visual image or a structure into language.  This is true not only for Art History students whose papers are often based on the visual analysis of images or monuments, but also for Studio Art students who write artist statements in which they verbally articulate ideas and influences that they have expressed visually in their work.</p>
        <note>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, all italicized quotes throughout this section are excerpted from the interview with Art and Art History faculty members at the University of Puget Sound that informed this section.</p>
        </note>
        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-art-genres">
            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>The most frequent types of papers students write in Art History courses include visual analysis papers, research papers, critical analyses of scholarly articles, and exhibition reviews.  While research papers and critical analyses of scholarly articles are similar to such papers in other disciplines (<eg/>, History or English), they likely include a visual analysis component that is not typical in other disciplines.  Visual analysis papers and exhibition reviews are genres unique to Art History and Art Criticism, and they both build on the close reading of a single object/monument or a close reading of a series objects and the space in which they are displayed.  Studio Art students frequently write exhibition reviews or responses, analyses of the work of an influential artist, and artist statements.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-art-purpose">
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p>The purpose of writing in Art and Art History courses is to derive meaning from visual works from the past and present, to become more skilled in visual literacy, and to develop and amplify skills of analysis and argumentation, and independent thinking.  Art and Art History papers will also develop your self-expression and facilitate your immersion in the creative field of Art or the scholarly field of Art History based upon sound research skills and careful, solid arguments.  Studio Art courses will prompt you to reflect carefully on your own artistic processes and ways of thinking and to articulate your relationship to the tradition of art-making.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-art-characteristics">
            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p>A unique characteristic of writing in Art History is its reliance on visual analysis. The ultimate goal of writing a visual analysis is to understand how the work you're writing about conveyed and conveys meaning.  A convincing visual analysis is an interpretation of the work that combines the examination of formal, experiential details in light of relevant contextual information, therefore close reading of visual information and the critical analysis of primary and secondary sources are valued characteristics of art historical writing.</p>
            <p>For visual analysis papers and exhibition reviews, the first step is translating your experience of what you see and what you feel or perceive with your senses into words; for example, when you stand in front of Michelangelo's <pubtitle>David</pubtitle> at the Gallery of the Academy in Florence, you not only look at the composition and carefully crafted details of the sculpture, you also react to its size, its placement on a high pedestal, your opportunity to walk around the figure, and the space where it is displayed and other visitors' reactions to it. When you are not able to visit the work in person, you should still try to imagine how it operates in its physical context, taking into account whether it is currently found in its original location.  Once you have performed this first, observational step, the second step in visual analysis is to contextualize the artwork you're writing about in its historical moment.  One way to contextualize an artwork is to compare it to works of art that have a similar subject matter, share its time period, or both. This kind of comparison will help you and your reader understand how the work fits into larger artistic developments. Another way to contextualize an artwork is to understand its social, religious, or cultural role by using primary textual sources (<eg/>, diaries of artists or patrons involved, documents of the work's commissioning, preparatory sketches or studies of the artist, newspaper articles that reveal how the work was received when it was first displayed, and historical accounts that describe the work). A third way to contextualize an artwork is to understand how it was originally displayed. A final contextualization strategy is to use the work of scholars who have studied the same monument or related monument to build on or refute.</p>
            <p>A common genre in Studio Art is an artist statement. The valued characteristics in an artist statement differ somewhat from those in a visual analysis. An artist statement is a short essay, about one page in length that is written in the first person. The purpose of artist statements is to articulate the processes, influences, and concepts that inform your independent artistic practices. These statements verbalize the multi-faceted ideas that inform artists' work, providing helpful context for viewers, curators, selection panels, and peers.  A compelling artist statement communicates significant elements about the motives and concerns that inspire works of art.  It can address a number of meaningful issues and influences such as your sense of identity, intellectual or technical aspects of your artistic process, and your position in relation to the history of your medium.  An artist statement is subjective in the sense that it reflects personal creative processes, yet it should also reflect and even interrogate broader cultural, social, political, and/or scientific themes.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-art-evidence">
            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p>For Art History papers, your evidence will be drawn from three types of sources: the visual evidence provided by the work of art that you are analyzing; primary textual sources that date to the same period as your visual evidence; and scholarly secondary sources.  Secondary scholarly sources can provide you with a framework for analysis, or can provide factual information about primary sources that the author used but you may not have easy access to. Secondary sources can also offer an interpretation of the work you are analyzing which you may accept or reject based on your own critical analysis of the work, primary sources, and the scholarly literature. You will need to document the sources of your ideas and information vigorously throughout your paper in order to show what sources you have used for your work; art historians typically use footnotes or endnotes for such purpose.</p>
            <p>Papers that you will write in Studio Art courses will focus primarily on visual evidence, although occasionally primary sources of artists' writings or secondary scholarly sources will also be used.</p>

            <p><ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Be selective. When you are writing a visual analysis, keep in mind that you will not be able to describe every detail of the work, so you will need to select the most dominant features that convey the meaning of the work. In organizing a visual analysis, always provide a brief description of the work as a whole before examining specific details of it more fully.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Be descriptive and analytical. When you describe visual features of an artwork in your visual analysis, explain why those aspects of the work contribute to the overall meaning conveyed by the work. Describing a visual feature of an artwork is similar to using quotes in other disciplines, such as History or English.  Just as you do not throw a quote from a primary or secondary source into your text without explaining its importance, do not let the visual evidence speak for itself, since a different viewer might draw different conclusions than what you are getting at.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Use Chicago Style to format your citations in Art History papers (see <xref ref="citations"/>).</p>

        <title>Writing for Biology</title>
        <p>Some students initially believe that writing is not important to science; however, lab reports are actually vital to understanding the context and the relevance of the science you are doing in lab and learning about in class, and their format allows scientists to communicate findings concisely and succinctly. After learning the specific skills that are needed, many students learn that they particularly enjoy writing for the natural sciences. Read this guide to learn about how writing for biology can be helpful and meaningful to you!</p>

            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>As in most science classes, the vast majority of the writing you do will be in the form of lab reports. Lab reports are papers based on an investigation that follows the standard template of an introduction, a methods section, a presentation of results, and a discussion of those results. In most biology classes you will be asked to write both full-length lab reports as well as individual sections of one for practice. Other kinds of writing that you may be asked to do include abstracts, critical reviews (in which you synthesize the primary literature on a topic) or, in upper-division classes, research proposals, and research papers.</p>

        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-biology-purpose">
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p><q><em>We spend so much time in lab on the methods portion and results portion, but lab reports are really helpful because they make us put our results in the greater context.</em></q></p>
            <p>It's entirely too easy to become myopic in lab (both figuratively and literally<mdash/>goggles don't help anyone's eyesight). Because of this possibility, lab reports become not only effective ways to communicate the results of an experiment to other scientists, but also good places to help you understand the science you have done more fully and in the context of biology as a discipline. Further, while the prescribed format may seem constraining, there is a reason why it has lasted: it can help you organize your own thoughts and give you the space to <q>step back</q> and find the larger frame for your experiment. In this way, lab reports are actually great opportunities to rethink what you've done in lab and learned in class on your own and to understand the larger import of the experiment you conducted.</p>

        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-biology-characteristics">
            <title>Traits and Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>I like to think of science almost like a coral reef you can build on: you build on what's beneath.</em></q></p>
            <p>The purpose of doing an experiment is never just to have done the experiment; rather, as the quote marking this subsection indicates, the purpose of a lab is not to repeat something already known but to build innovatively on what you've learned, allowing you to explore the emergent properties of scientific knowledge. This idea is particularly important to remember when you're writing for biology because writing in biology requires that you frame any experimental description with the <q>why</q> behind your research.</p>
            <p>Further, because biology is a natural science, it adheres to the principles of the scientific method, requiring objectivity, reproducibility, and quantitative results. For these reasons it's important to communicate clearly and efficiently in a style that reflects this objectivity and relies on quantitative values rather than vague words like <q>more</q> or <q>greater.</q></p>
            <p>While there is a convention-driven style to a lot of science writing in which you follow established norms, a good scientist thinks creatively about the field, where the gaps are, and where they can contribute. In this way, there is always room within the individual sections and their connecting links to explain ideas in an innovative way, ask creative questions, and propose new ideas for future research.</p>

            <p>Because biology is a natural science, the only kind of data you should use is empirical, reproducible data you have collected yourself or data from a peer-reviewed, secondary source published in a scholarly journal. Quoting is generally discouraged, although there are exceptions for research papers, proposals, or grants.</p>

It's easier to reverse-engineer your paper by starting with figures, tables, and the methods and results sections, and then working your way through the discussion, finishing with your title and introduction. This approach will allow you to focus the information that you include in your introduction so that it is relevant to the rest of the experiment rather than wasting time writing about things that aren't relevant.</p></li>
                <li><p>Rely on the formatting given to you by your professors. Specifically ask your professor about whether they prefer active or passive voice<mdash/>this issue is still up for debate in science writing, and different professors (and different branches of the field) have different policies.</p></li>

            <p>The purpose of writing for business classes isn't exactly the same as the purpose of writing in the professional business world: classes are specifically designed for you to practice and improve your writing skills, whereas the professional world is often more results oriented. For this reason, academic papers are generally more focused and less broad than professional ones so that you will have enough time to do a thorough job. Despite the difference between class and the professional world, you should treat the business essays you write as though they were directed at a real professional audience. Accordingly, because your imagined audience is made up of practicing professionals, it's important to remember that, whereas in most other disciplines you are only trying to persuade someone to <em>believe</em> something, in business you are trying to persuade someone to believe something <em>so that they will do something</em>. You can think of your writing as a tool you can use to have a direct impact on a person's, company's, or government's actions.</p>

            <p><q><em>Don't make your reader do the work. You need to do all the work.</em></q></p>
            <p>Writing for business should be as direct, simple, concise, and accurate as possible<mdash/>don't use too many adjectives or try to sound poetic. Although this spare style of writing may feel impersonal, there are very important reasons to use it. The writing done for business in the professional world is used directly in decision-making. In consequence, the conventions of business writing are oriented toward informing your readers so that they can make their decisions as accurately and efficiently as possible. By being direct and simple, you allow your audience to understand the situation and ideas you are describing while simultaneously making it clear to that audience that you understand the situation and are a competent source. By being concise, you show that you are efficient and that you value your readers' time, and by being accurate you show your reader that you are willing to be honest and realistic.</p>
            <p>Further, within these guidelines there is room to be creative: an important part of business writing is innovation. In the last part of many business papers (such as case studies) you will be asked to suggest possible solutions to the problem or question you've outlined in the body of your paper. This is a place in your writing where you get to think innovatively about the possible futures and outcomes of various choices, and present your ideas about how best to implement strategies to ensure the best possible future. In this part of your writing it's particularly important to be value neutral: these possible solutions are not about what a person <em>should</em> do; these possible solutions are about what a person or company <em>can</em> do.</p>

                <li><p>Proofread your paper for spelling and grammar. While grammar may seem less important to some writers, imagine that you are a business executive sending an email to your staff.

                <li><p>You can use subheadings to organize your papers. While subheadings are discouraged in some disciplines, feel free to use them for business papers to add extra clarity and formality.</p></li>
                <li><p>Don't use clichés, contractions, or passive clauses. And while personal pronouns are okay, don't start a sentence with <q>I think.</q> While these rules may seem overly fastidious, it's important to follow them so that your writing is both professional and reflective of your own distinctive voice. Using clichés is counterproductive to both of these values because they aren't your own words and they are not particularly professional. Further, starting a sentence with <q>I think</q> can sound demure rather than convincing. And finally, using passive clauses rather than active ones can sometimes emphasize the responsibility or actions of the subject of a sentence. Write actively to ensure that your prose is fluid and compelling.</p></li>

        <p>Writing can sometimes seem like an obstacle for science students. Within scientific culture, the importance of effective communication is often underemphasized. This under emphasis leads many students entering college to see science writing as, at best, a necessary evil, and at worst, a tangled mess of jargon and arbitrary formatting. So far from being true, the exact opposite is the case. In the wise words of <custom item="chemistry-professor"/>, <q>Science is in the communication. Science doesn't exist in someone's head.

            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>Writing in chemistry is challenging for new students since there are many different types of writing in chemistry. However, most of these genres can be broken down into a shared set of sections, each with its own distinctive style and purpose: a title, an abstract, an introduction, an experimental section, a results section, a discussion, a conclusion, and a literature cited. Together, these sections make up the most fundamental genre in chemistry writing: research articles (<ie/>, lab reports). Further, these sections also make up the research posters, review articles, and research proposals you'll be introduced to in upper-level classes. The only kind of writing in chemistry not made up by these sections is the notes you'll take in your laboratory notebook.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-chemistry-purpose">
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p>The purpose of chemistry writing depends on the genre. A lab notebook is meant to be fairly informal, but clear and detailed enough that another chemist unfamiliar with the experiment you're doing could open up your notebook and repeat the experiment. Keeping this kind of detailed record of your lab work will allow you to go back later and understand what it was you did in lab. In turn, understanding what you did will give you the context you need to write an informed lab report and thus make the process much easier.</p>
            <p>These lab reports are formal papers that are meant to be places for you to practice sorting through, presenting and analyzing data. Further, lab reports also give you practice deepening your understanding of what you did in lab by allowing you to see your knowledge gaps and fill them by looking things up or asking your classmates and professor. Last but not least, lab reports are the avenues of communicating your results to faculty and other scientists, making them the crucial places where science really occurs.</p>

            <p><q><em>Brevity may be the soul of wit, but it is the cerebrum of good science writing.</em></q></p>
            <p>When you write for chemistry, be clear, concise, and precise. In art, ambiguity is often ripe with meaning, but in scientific writing ambiguity is distracting. One of the most common writing errors chemistry students make is being vague when they should be precise. Don't say <q>the product was obtained in good yield</q> when you could just as easily say <q>the aldehyde 3 was obtained in 64% yield,</q> a statement that contains much more useful information for other scientists trying to replicate your experiment.</p>
            <p>Despite the importance of clarity, being precise shouldn't prevent you from telling a story with your data: structuring a lab report as a narrative is a higher-level skill that can turn a seemingly mundane paper into a compelling one. Your Title provides a hook to draw in the reader; then the Introduction sets the narrative background and poses the problem that needs solving; the Experimental and Results sections show how your protagonist has interrogated nature, and the answers they have gained; and then the Discussion puts the results in context with other results cited in the Intro (by either verifying or contesting them) while forcing you to explain why this might be. Of course there are often questions left unanswered, or new questions that arose in the course of the work; these then appear at the end of the Discussion to entice the reader to look for the sequel (that is, the reader's own subsequent research).</p>

            <p>Evidence in chemistry<mdash/>as in all natural sciences<mdash/>is exclusively empirical, reproducible data from experiments you have done yourself or from a peer-reviewed, scholarly source. As the quote marking this subsection suggests, it can be very helpful to organize your results and explain the context you give in your introduction using figures and tables. These tables and figures are a powerful way to harness your evidence if you pair them with descriptive captions and embed them in the text of your lab report.

            <p><ul>
                <li><p>Don't write from beginning to end. Many students think they should write a report in the order that it appears, but this is often an inefficient way to write a research paper<mdash/>the abstract comes immediately after the title, but it should normally be written last, because it is easier to summarize the research after you've written the entire report and have thus refined your understanding of the research. Although there is no one-size-fits-all approach, here is an order that is usually effective: Organize your thoughts and your data, write the Experimental Section, prepare the important illustrations (<ie/>, Tables, Figures, and Schemes), write the Results section (using the illustrations as a guide), draft an outline of the Discussion section, write the Introduction, complete the Discussion Section, write the Conclusions, add References, write the Title and Abstract.</p></li>
                <li><p>Start early and get help if needed. Usually professors won't have time to go over your whole draft, so make sure you go into office hours or send an email with a few specific questions for them to answer.</p></li>
                <li><p>Know your audience. You are writing for other chemists with a similar level of knowledge to your own but who are not familiar with the exact experiments you performed. You don't have to go into gory detail about procedures that any chemist should know<mdash/>it is even OK to use a little jargon if it is part of the chemist's lexicon. For example, <q>the reaction was heated at reflux for 2 hours</q> is perfectly clear to any chemist who has taken organic chemistry.</p></li>
                <li><p>Delete superfluous words: don't say <q>the melting point <em>was determined to be</em> 198-199ºC,</q> say <q>the melting point <em>is</em> 198-199ºC.</q></p></li>
                <li><p>Chemical names are not capitalized (unless they are trade names).</p></li>
                <li><p>All manuscripts should be double-spaced (unless told otherwise).</p></li>

        <title>Writing for English</title>
        <p>Many students entering college think they know what writing for an English class should be like: While most students haven't taken a psychology or Science, Technology, and Society class, the majority of students have taken several English classes before college and have prior experience writing English papers. Depending on their experiences, students may believe that English writing is congenitally imprecise and emotional because it is founded on subjective opinions rather than facts because <q>there are no right answers.</q> Alternately, students may think that English papers are brittle five-paragraph essays that impoverish the texts that they analyze. While these assumptions can be hard to displace, English essays are neither unsubstantiated opinions nor life-sucking exercises in pedantry. Rather, English essays can be powerful transformations of your impressions and emotions of a text into a substantiated analysis that reveals the more profound underpinnings of that text. Read this guide to get an idea of how to get the most out of writing for English!</p>

            <p>Although you'll be asked to write in scads of different genres for your English classes, close readings are the foundation on which all English writing rests. Close readings are essentially papers that ask you to move beyond saying <em>that</em> something exists in a text (for instance, alliteration), to <em>how</em> it's used: That is, what it suggests in relation to other elements of the text, and why that realization matters. Longer papers in English classes can take the form of open-ended research papers, or analysis of the relationships between a text and its historical moment; however, these longer papers are built upon extended close readings for which you will have developed a theoretical framework. Other genres in English include many kinds of creative writing, such as personal essays, memoirs, and poetry, as well as book reviews or letters. You may be asked to write in these creative genres in traditional English classes as well as creative writing English classes.</p>

            <p>The purpose of writing in English classes is to become a better writer and a better reader. In your English classes your professors don't want you to put on an analytic production just for the professor's eyes; rather, you are being asked to take a step in a larger series of conversations that will allow you to practice habits of mind and transferable analytical skills. Hopefully these habits of mind will include a deeper appreciation for the profound and subtle ways language shapes our imagined realities, as well as how our own theoretical biases affect how we read a text.</p>

            <p><q><em>Show me that I'm progressing. <ellipsis/> I want to feel like I'm learning with the paper.</em></q></p>
            <p>Writing for English, perhaps more so than any other discipline, emphasizes the process or craft of an essay rather than the product. This emphasis is inherent to the discipline because English is so consummately qualitative: you are not presenting quantitative data or known observations and conclusions. Rather you are making a qualitative analysis that puts your data (your textual observations) into a meaningful pattern and then commenting on the overall meaning or effect of that pattern. In this way, the form of an English essay is just as important as its content: <em>how</em> you have organized your ideas and presented them is just as important as the ideas themselves. For this reason English papers should not be like lists of evidence; rather, they should show the development of an argument over the course of an essay, with each paragraph advancing the argument.</p>
            <p>Because the writer's process of thought is so important to the English essay, your professors will tell you that good reading is the beginning of good writing and that the process of good reading is itself good thinking: how you read will be reflected in how you write<mdash/>meaning that to be able to write well you yourself must think critically, take notes, and make observations while you read instead of merely absorbing the words on the page.</p>
            <p>One aspect of English essays that can be a stumbling block to students is also the thing that can make it so rewarding: Far from having a single correct answer, texts have a multitude of possible solutions and interpretations. Because there is no absolute, definitive interpretation, many students can be caught in the difference between opinions and arguments: sometimes it can feel unnerving to make an interpretive leap because you think that it isn't 100% certain<mdash/>but that's actually the nature of the claims we make as English writers: while they are substantiated, they are fundamentally arguable. An arguable claim is different from an opinion in that arguments are substantiated by textual evidence while opinions are not.</p>

                <li><p>Although English writing has a reputation for being florid and ornate, as in every other discipline, good writing is clear writing. Don't use as many adverbs as possible or sacrifice clarity and coherence for an elevated register.</p></li>

        <p>Among scholars, historians are unique in their pursuit of knowledge from pasts that only get further away rather than clearer as time goes on. The difficulty of sometimes vast amounts of elapsed time combined with the intense and often bewildering particularity of different historical moments can make writing academically about history challenging for students.

            <p>Of the several kinds of writing you will be asked to do in your history classes, close readings of a primary source are perhaps the most foundational. A close reading is a paper in which you develop an analytical argument that takes into account the historical context the source is from. The skills you use to write a primary source close reading are transferable to the secondary source critiques that you will be asked to write. Another way to think of these critiques is as a way to <q>test other scholars.</q> Other history papers include papers that put primary and secondary sources in conversation with one another, annotated bibliographies, research prospectuses and comparisons of a historian's versus a popular source's version of an event to elucidate the difference between how historians and how others think about the past.</p>

            <p>Unlike writing in many other academic disciplines, most good historical writing is open and accessible to the general reader. Part of the purpose of historical writing, then, is to bring the stories and patterns of the past to the attention of modern readers. Within these stories and patterns are the figures of the past. These figures can sometimes seem very strange, they can seem evil, they can seem funny, but they are ultimately human beings, and your task as a historian is to make sense of them from their perspectives to the extent to which that's possible<mdash/>and it's a task that is, in fact, impossible. And that's part of what you can love about it: Your job is to try to make sense of a puzzle, always knowing that you can't quite get there.</p>

            <p><q><em>Imagination is really important. <q>Analytical</q> for us isn't like looking through a microscope, but having to really imagine, and being willing to think about things in new ways.</em></q></p>
            <p>Writing for history can be very difficult because you are, in essence, being asked to disregard what you know<mdash/>what your present has taught you<mdash/>and recreate a world that you have never seen and that has ceased existing. For this reason, historical writing is an act of inquiry that is both logical and imaginative. To be a good historian you must begin by making observations and then use these observations to ask good questions that will help you re-imagine the past in a new way or to find the gaps in existing ways of understanding it. These questions and new ways of seeing will allow you to gain a deeper knowledge of the past and, hopefully, a deeper empathy for its figures.</p>
            <p>A second important part of writing historically is understanding that making a historical argument does not mean disregarding your sources to write what you want; rather, it means to allow your observations to help you make a convincing argument by presenting them in the truest possible way: historians feel they have an ethical responsibility to not abuse their evidence, to not do violence to the sources of the past, to not force a source to say something that it did not intend to say. For this reason, when you make an interpretive leap you must justify it so that you do not misrepresent a source.</p>
            <p>This second characteristic of historical writing is often called being <q>value neutral.</q> However, being value neutral doesn't mean that historians don't see things as right and wrong<mdash/>instead it means that in order to actually be able to distinguish one from the other a historian must first begin by understanding the people of the past<mdash/>and you can't do that unless you have put aside your own moral lens long enough to figure them out. Putting aside your lenses is, indeed, the thing that will allow you to ask the questions you will need to ask in order to imagine the past<mdash/>questions that are not merely factual, that are not anachronistic or judgmental, but analytical.</p>

        <p>While everyone has heard, and probably even played, music, writing about it is an entirely different province; so even if you are the most ardent music-lover, be prepared to find writing about music unfamiliar. Read this guide to learn more about the skills you will need to write well about music.</p>

            <p>Some music-writing genres<mdash/>the sort that require extensive knowledge of terminology<mdash/>are limited to music majors and include analytical papers in which you will look at a score and make an argument about it using technical descriptions of its subtleties as evidence. Other music-writing genres<mdash/>which do not require heavy amounts of technical vocabulary<mdash/>will be assigned to both majors and non-majors. These less technical papers include a version of the analytical paper, where you write a listening guide for a piece of music; book reviews, patterned after professional book reviews, where you review books dealing with musical issues; field work papers, where you analyze the interaction between music and culture on or off campus; reception histories, where you describe the reception of a particular composer when they were alive, and analyze why and how that reception changed over time; broader versions of reception histories, where you take a work where there is a critical mass of scholarship and then combine analysis, history, and criticism of that work; performance reports, informal pieces of writing where you describe what you heard at a performance, what the event was like, and how the audience responded; as well as conventional research papers.</p>

            <p>Like most endeavors, writing academically about music has many entwined purposes. First of all, writing about music will help you learn about music. This will mean going beyond your subjective reaction to a score and exploring the details of its artistry. Further, by learning to write well about music, you will also foster writing skills that you will be able to apply to other kinds of writing that you will do in future. Still more, by writing papers about music, you will be joining a scholarly conversation, whose complex and multifarious voices will push you to evaluate complex arguments and learning how to persuade others yourself.</p>

            <p><q><em>How the heck do you write about sound?</em></q></p>
            <p>One of the greatest stumbling blocks for new music writers can sometimes be the thing that drew you to music in the first place; we have all heard music, and we love it and know how important it is. But being able to transform that love into a profound and specific analysis of the <q>hows</q> and <q>whys</q> of a chosen piece of music is an exercise in patience and practice. But hang in there! That exercise will lead you to a deeper appreciation for music than you began with.</p>
            <p>When you are writing about texts, you are using words to analyze words. However, when writing about musical texts, the thing you are analyzing is sound, which is invisible. So in order to write well about music you will need to meaningfully translate what you hear into writing.</p>
            <p>When you are trying to do the work of such meaningful translation, when you are listening to and looking at a score, there will always be an infinite number of ways of looking at it, some of which are more persuasive and reasonable than others. In order to write persuasively, and choose which way to <q>look</q> at a score or even a book, the most important thing to keep in mind is to go beyond description. While description is a great starting point<mdash/>because good description ensures that you are paying attention and noticing what is unusual<mdash/>analysis requires explaining why that something is unusual or significant.</p>

            <p>In your music classes, just like your English and history classes, evidence is almost exclusively textual. However in music-writing, scores and performances are also considered to be texts, and accurate descriptions of them are what constitute evidence. Unlike in the sciences, you won't be creating evidence yourself (by doing an experiment), instead you are finding evidence in secondary sources and by your own observation.</p>

                <li><p>Describing music involves using a series of agreed-upon metaphors (e.g. a wet sound v. a dry sound). While such terminology can be daunting, it can be very helpful when writing about sound.</p></li>
                <li><p>With the above tip in mind, there is sometimes a misconception that when you are writing about music it has to be really jargon-laden and technical. If you are uncomfortable with writing about music, it is always better to say what you have to say clearly rather than throwing words out like a cloud of squid ink.</p></li>
                <li><p>Because music takes place in time, there is a tendency to work your way through a piece that you are writing about from beginning to end. Part of mastery is not being stuck doing this kind of <q>inchworm</q> writing. If you notice yourself using <q>and then</q> a lot, think about whether you could organize your thoughts in a more persuasive way.</p></li>
                <li><p>Make sure to refer specifically to the measure in a score or the timing in a recording when describing a musical piece.</p></li>

        <title>Writing for Psychology</title>
        <p>Psychology presents unique challenges to student writers: It can be difficult to navigate between quantitative scientific data and the ineluctably qualitative arguments that you'll need to make about human behavior. Read this guide to get a better idea of what it's important to focus on while writing for psychology!</p>

            <p>There are two main kinds of writing in psychology. The first is research reports, in which you will convey to your audience the research you have done, the reason you did it, what method you did it by, and the results and conclusions you arrived at. The second type of writing you will do is literature reviews, in which you will write papers focused on canvassing a particular area of research to generate new conclusions about that area. Another type of writing you may be asked to do that is less common is translational writing, in which you will be asked to <q>translate</q> scientific writing for general audiences.</p>

            <p>The purpose of writing in psychology is, at its most fundamental level, to communicate our understanding of behavior and mental processes. Because knowledge in psychology can make a good and meaningful difference in the lives of people, it is paramount that your writing is understandable. In order to promote meaningful change in people's lives, you must first be able to communicate the findings of empirical research effectively to both other scientists and larger audiences.</p>

            <p><q><em>The goal is to be honest.</em></q></p>
            <p>Because psychology is a science and psychological writing is used to change how individuals and societies think about and treat others, it is crucial that arguments are made honestly and using empirical data. In your essays, it's therefore important that you prioritize presenting your data fairly over pushing your own interpretation of the data. Instead, while you make your argument you should allow room for alternate explanations: be honest about what you know and what you don't know and recognize the limitations of your argument.</p>
            <p>In your attempt to be as honest as possible with your findings, you will be aided by being precise and concise rather than ambiguous and flowery. It is difficult to be straightforward if your writing is confusing or vague about what your results actually are and how you obtained them.</p>
            <p>While presenting the facts of your research clearly and plainly is vital, it is equally important to <q>go beyond the data</q> by writing about its applied relevance in interdisciplinary and ethical spaces.</p>

            <p><q><em>In psychology, you can almost never see the thing you want to know<nbsp/><ellipsis/><nbsp/></em></q></p>
            <p>The data you use should be empirical rather than textual. For this reason, a theory from a secondary source is not evidence, and most professors discourage the use of quotes. However, while psychological data is scientific, <em>how</em> you interpret it is inherently qualitative. While in the natural sciences, for example, if you want to know the temperature at which a metal melts, you can take a thermometer and watch and see when it melts and you'll know the answer: you can observe the physical process you want to know about directly. In psychology you can almost never see the psychological process you want to know about because it's inside a person. For example, you could have an idea that a pharmaceutical increases hunger and then, when you give this pharmaceutical to people they eat more. Did the pharmaceutical increase hunger? Possibly. That's a good possible explanation for what happened, but you didn't see hunger, you just saw eating and you have to make a link between what you saw (which was people eating) and the underlying thing you think is in there (which is hunger). In this way, while the data you collect are wholly scientific, the way you choose to explain that evidence is, by nature, conjectural.</p>

        <title>Writing for International Political Economy</title>
        <p>Writing for International Political Economy (<init>IPE</init>) can be difficult because, although it’s a social science and subscribes to these writing conventions, it requires clearly integrating the social, cultural, economic, and political dimensions of international issues in order to develop sufficient depth into your topic, a task that can initially be overwhelming. Additionally, <init>IPE</init> research is not just an intellectual exercise; it has vast real-world impacts. Policy briefs and theories can shape generations of international relations and have drastic effects on people’s lives around the globe. Therefore, along with learning how to research and organize your ideas, it is important to write with intention and care about the greater implications of what you are arguing. Read this guide to learn more about important aspects of writing for <init>IPE</init>!</p>

            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>The vast majority of <init>IPE</init> writing is explanatory, analytical, and synthetic. Three of the most common types of papers you will be asked to write for <init>IPE</init> are research papers, position papers, and essays analyzing course readings. Research papers require you to find outside sources to formulate and support your argument. Position papers typically include an explanatory portion, as if you were writing a report for your employer about your topic, and an analytical section where you will use <init>IPE</init> theories to evaluate the current state of your topic. In other essays you will be asked an analytical question about readings you have done in class and expected to summarize the authors’ complex arguments, identify points of agreement and disagreement among authors, and incorporate relevant passages from the readings into your writing that elaborate (rather than simply re-state) your point; these essays are an opportunity to deepen and showcase your understanding of the course readings. You may also be asked to write case studies, outlining the development of a particular issue, international relationship, or country over time; policy briefs, summarizing a particular issue, its policy options, and your recommendations; and reflections, where you’ll describe your own personal standpoint on an issue. One of the common writing challenges in these genres is covering enough breadth to develop sufficient depth on your topic. As you write, work to integrate the political, social, cultural, and economic perspectives of your topic and explain in detail how they relate to one another. Also, don’t merely summarize readings, but instead put the authors in conversation with one another; look at the points that authors agree or disagree on and come up with a unique angle on how they speak to each other (for example, how might one author expand upon an idea developed by an earlier author?).</p>

            <p>The purpose of writing in <init>IPE</init> is to develop the written communication skills that will make you most effective in your job when you graduate. Many careers that draw on IPE will require you to write succinctly, and to synthesize complicated international issues into digestible documents that combine many perspectives and nuances. <init>IPE</init> papers are an opportunity for you to develop these skills. They are also an opportunity to test your command of classroom and research material and identify what you don’t know. Putting complicated <init>IPE</init> frameworks, policies, and theories into words is an opportunity for both you and your professors to assess your mastery of the topics and theories at hand. <init>IPE</init> papers are also an opportunity to develop information literacy, to know when more research is needed, and to locate, evaluate, and use scholarly and gray literature effectively as evidence for your argument.</p>

            <p><em><q>It’s vital to be concise, specific, not make generalizations, and not speak vaguely and broadly.</q></em></p>
            <p>The professional world of <init>IPE</init> focuses heavily on international relations and economics, and your writing may be used to make important decisions that have huge impacts on people's lives around the world. Therefore, valuable characteristics of <init>IPE</init> writing include clarity, conciseness, specificity, and consideration of many perspectives of a debate. Though nuance is important, clarity and conciseness are key because many of the topics you will write about are complex and in order for your future employer to be able to make a well supported decision they need to easily and clearly understand the state of the issue from your writing. Specificity is also imperative; broad generalizations and sweeping statements are almost always inaccurate and do not help your reader understand the true nature of the issue you are writing about.</p>
            <p>It is also important to recognize that you will not emerge from your writing with a clear answer to your topic. The top experts on an issue have dedicated their lives to this research and still disagree with one another on the solutions. For all of the scholars with whom you agree, there are scholars who have counterarguments for their points. Therefore, you should work to put authors in conversation with one another and anticipate counterarguments when you are making a claim. Additionally, because <init>IPE</init> theories have real-world impacts, it is crucial to openly evaluate both sides of a debate and really think about the implications.</p>

Gray literature is research from outside of academia, including government documents and reports from organizations such as the World Bank or the <init>UN</init>.

                    <p>Learning the difference between an opinion and an argument is key for writing a strong <init>IPE</init> paper. An opinion is based on values or beliefs and doesn’t necessarily have to be supported with evidence. You can disregard all of the evidence to the contrary and still hold onto your opinion. An argument must be something about which other reasonable parties could disagree and it must be supportable with evidence. When writing an <init>IPE</init> paper, don’t take off running with your first opinion and try to find sources to support it. Instead, take the time to read sources and build an argument before writing.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Your professors may disagree about aspects of your paper (such as having a roadmap sentence in your introduction) or emphasize different features (such as having a contained introduction).

                <li>
                    <p>The amount of research you do indicates to your professor how much effort you have put into your paper; often professors look at the reference page before reading your paper to get a sense of the scope and depth of your research. Therefore, to write a strong paper you should do a lot of research, go well above the minimum number of sources required, and cite everything!</p>

Writing code is a fundamental skill in <init>CS</init>, and while it’s different than any other form of writing it still requires organization and clarity. Other writing in <init>CS</init> includes commenting code to give it longevity and utility to other coders, and academic papers to share your work with other computer scientists. Read this section to learn some strategies for effective writing in computer science classes! Writing for <init>CS</init> classes generally takes two forms: Code and code comments, and formal academic papers. Because these two genres are so different, this chapter is split into a section for each. Other writing takes the form of less formal responses and short assignments. These will vary considerably and your professor’s instructions will provide the best guidelines.</p>

                <title>Purpose</title>
                <p>Coding is the meat of computer science, and comments are critical for communicating what your code does to other users. Though comments are usually short and don’t always contain full sentences, they never-the-less require clear communication of the most important ideas. Comments generally fall into two categories: informal and formal. Informal comments are notes sprinkled throughout the code that annotate the algorithm to make it clearer for anyone who needs to work with it (including your future self!). Because computer code can be incredibly tedious to understand, and because two people will write different algorithms to accomplish the same goal, the purpose of these comments is to make your code more human-readable and to communicate the main ideas and steps in your code, as you would if outlining an essay. Informal comments do not need to follow an official style guide. In fact, they don’t even have to be complete sentences, but they should be clear and easy to understand. Formal comments (such as Javadoc comments in the Java language) explain the functionality and any inputs (parameters) and outputs (returns) of your methods, fields, and classes. They must follow a specific format so that they can be used to generate a webpage outlining the functionality of the code and giving instructions to use it. To write formal comments, carefully follow your professor’s directions and/or provided style guides. Good comments, both informal and formal, should not state obvious parts of your code, such as that you are using a loop; they should convey what the code does, but not unnecessary details about how it does it.</p>

                    <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
                    <p><q><em>All of the writing I give to my students is an attempt to have them practice the skills they will be doing when they are professionals.</em></q></p>
                    <p>Concise and precise writing are vital for good comments. The comment should include everything someone might need to use the code successfully, but nothing they can tell just from looking at it. One comment for every 4<ndash/>5 lines of code is generally a good amount, but it can vary depending on the complexity of your work. Comments should tell the user <em>what</em> the code does, but not all of the details of <em>how</em> it does it.</p>
                    <p>When writing code, efficiency is also highly valued. This doesn’t mean that the shortest code is best, but code that makes the computer do less work, use less space, and run faster (e.g., has smaller <term>time complexity</term> and <term>space complexity</term>) is valued professionally, where the efficiency of your code can cost or save money and impact customer satisfaction. As you code, think about ways to eliminate redundant code and use less computer memory. In the earlier days of computing, when memory was expensive, writing compact code was an important skill. However, in modern times the professional value of human readable and intuitive code is much higher.</p>

                    <title>Conventions and Tips</title>
                    <p><ul>
                        <li><p>Exact formatting, down to use of punctuation and white space, is critical in formal commenting and coding because a computer needs to be able to generate a documentation website from what you write. <em>Read and use style guides to make sure your comments are properly formatted!</em></p></li>
                        <li><p>The number of informal comments you should have throughout your code varies with the complexity of the code you are annotating and the language you are writing in. When writing in Java, a higher-level (more human-readable) language, you can expect to comment on average every 4<ndash/>5 lines. However, when writing assembly code, which is much lower-level (and consequently difficult to read), it is standard to comment every line of code.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Many <init>CS</init> classes involve pair or group programming. When working with others, be sure to set yourself up to share the work equally. Choose a workspace where everyone is involved and pass the computer back and forth between logical units. Be self aware about the amount and ways you contribute, and give your partner space to contribute. Be open-minded and curious about what your partner has to add to the project.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Write your comments as you write your code, even if you need to go back and alter them later, rather than hurriedly adding them right before turning in your assignment. As you write longer and more complicated code and work as part of a team of programmers, it will be increasingly difficult to remember what your idea was when writing old code, and your colleagues will need to stay updated on your code as you write it because their code may depend on your implementation.</p></li>

                    <title>Coding and academic honesty</title>
                    <p>Code is a form of writing, and, even when programming a simple task, one person’s code differs from another’s in the same way essays differ. While tons of code is available online (such as on Stack Overflow) and sharing code is useful in more advanced projects, copying someone’s code without crediting them <em>is plagiarism</em> (see <xref ref="plagiarism"/>). If you are unsure about whether you can use code you found online or elsewhere, always ask your professor.</p>

                <title>Writing Academic Papers</title>
                    <p>Academic conference papers present your work to the academic community, and are formally written in active voice and generally about 8 pages in length. They are divided into sections like methods and introduction. They are centered around a project that you or your team performed, and clearly communicate what you did and what you found to the larger community of scientists. A paper should place your work in context and explain what it contributes or why it is valuable.</p>

                                <p>The purpose of <init>CS</init> papers, like in other sciences, is to contribute to academic knowledge in the field and share your work. The audience is other computer scientists, though not necessarily in your specific subsection of the field. A paper shares new ideas or contributions, so that others can learn from them and potentially build on your work. While student papers may or may not actually be presented at a conference, they are practice for this type of academic work and should be written with the same goals in mind.</p>

                                <p><q><em>If you're on the monkey bars, you have to have one hand here and then you reach out and grab here and then you let that go and you reach out and grab here. At no point do you let go with both hands. In the same way you are carrying your reader from one sentence to the next to the next and you can't let them go.</em></q></p>
                                <p>In academic papers, computer scientists must be able to convey complex ideas with enough detail and clarity that their colleagues can understand them. Therefore, it’s vital for the writer be able to break down complicated ideas into precise, logical steps. This is sometimes referred to as <term>algorithmic thinking</term>. For example, think about the level of clarity that would be required to teach a child to perform a task like tying their shoes... over the phone. Your writing should walk the reader through every step, never making logical jumps that might leave them behind. It should start at the beginning and introduce all the important terms and notation before you use them.</p>
                                <p>Concise writing is also valued in <init>CS</init>. While you should include anything the reader will need to understand, avoid unnecessarily fancy words or sentence structures. The ideas are complex and difficult to understand, but your writing should not be. <q>Untwist</q> your sentences, clearly linking nouns and verbs and avoiding dangling phrases. Likewise, precision in language (see <xref ref="style-writing-clearly"/>) is very important. Avoid vague phrases or sweeping claims. Instead, use language that conveys your ideas as exactly as possible without going beyond the scope of your work. The main challenge is including all the necessary information, but nothing extra.</p>

                                <p>In <init>CS</init> papers, evidence takes the form of data sets or models from your own work, as well as previous related information or conclusions from other peer-reviewed academic papers. This often includes equations or tables mixed with text. Be sure to meticulously interpret these data for your reader, as they are often confusing. When using evidence from others, also be sure to explain how it relates to your topic and to cite it properly. For your data to be meaningful, think about how you can use experiments to measure and convey the success of your project. This gives your work meaning and context for a larger audience.</p>

        <title>Writing for Mathematics</title>
        <p>Contrary to the popular belief that mathematics and writing are opposites, strong writing skills will make you a better mathematician. Writing for mathematics is all about communicating complex ideas with precision and concision. Initially new genres like proofs may be intimidating, but practice, your professors, and this section can help you learn the craft of writing in the field of Mathematics.

            <title>Genres</title>
            <p><q><em>You shouldn’t be afraid to do proofs.</em></q></p>
            <p>The fundamental genre of writing in mathematics is the proof. In a proof, a mathematician walks through the logical steps from a known statement to prove another statement. Proofs should be devoid of complexity beyond the logical steps required to prove the statement. They range in length from just a few lines to several pages or longer, depending on the complexity of the problem.</p>
            <p>The other genre more common in upper division mathematics classes is a paper using mathematics to solve real-world problems. This genre involves more expository writing, as the problem must be used to write a mathematical model, and then the results of the model must be contextualized with respect to the original problem. They are generally 5-7 pages in length, including graphics. </p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Purpose</title>
                <p>The purpose of writing in mathematics is to work through difficult ideas and communicate them clearly. Writing helps develop and deepen thinking. Proofs are applications of complex concepts and methods learned in class; in order to write them successfully, you have to explore and understand those ideas, a process that facilitates learning.</p>
                <p>In the professional mathematical world, a proof is also something more, a way of demonstrating (proving!) previously unknown knowledge to the academic community. While student proofs are not usually new discoveries, they require the student to practice the same kinds of thinking and logical moves required for more advanced academic work. </p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>Erdős (a famous mathematician) said that God has a book with all the proofs in it… and when you wrote a nice proof he would say, ‘oh, that’s from the book.’</em></q></p>
            <p>Precision and concision are the most highly valued characteristics in mathematical writing. Precision means that the piece of writing is logically correct. You cannot write a good proof without correct logic. Concision means that the ideas are communicated efficiently, without anything unnecessary included. For example, if you’re using a theorem from the book, cite it instead of writing the entire thing out again. Avoid unnecessary explanations like “now I will show that X is 3…” instead, simply show it. Concision also means knowing your audience and not including details they would already know. For most proofs, the expected audience is another student doing reasonably well in your class, who wouldn’t need to see every basic algebraic step you took. If, for example, you already covered solving systems of equations in class, there’s no need to list every step you used to solve a system. You can simply tell the reader what technique you used and what the results were. Concision, along with mathematical elegance, also means using big theorems that move the proof along in fewer steps. A good proof does its work as efficiently as possible, without descending into detailed computations where they aren’t needed. </p>
            <p>To write concisely, also keep in mind that a proof is the logic itself, not the story of how you worked it out. X did not become three when you figured it out; it always was three, and you simply discovered that fact. In the process of writing a proof, you will likely struggle down many dead ends, but the final project should only include the most efficient logical steps. </p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p>Pre-existing theorems and definitions are important starting evidence, which are generally cited from the textbook. Mathematical equations, incorporated into the text in complete sentences, also provide evidence. In more applied projects, working out specific cases or examples of a theorem can also provide important explanation. Longer projects might also cite mathematical literature, usually books and occasionally journal articles. </p>

            <p><ul>
                <li><p>A proof is a piece of writing in paragraph form. This means that even when mathematical equations are used, they go within complete sentences with proper punctuation.</p></li>
                <li><p>When possible, don’t start sentences with numbers or symbols.</p></li>
                <li><p>Proofs are written in the present tense using the first person plural (<q>we</q>). Write as though you are walking through the logical steps with the reader.</p></li>
                <li><p>Choose notation carefully and define variables, parameters, and constants clearly when they are introduced. </p></li>
                <li><p>While expressions are used in text, don’t use shorthand like replacing the words “less than” with the <q>&lt;</q> symbol.</p></li>
                <li><p>Be thoughtful when inserting graphics: use consistent designs that convey contents clearly, and be sure to reference them in the text.</p></li>
                <li><p>Mathematical writing is generally done in <latex/>, a document markup language. This makes proper formatting of equations in text much more elegant.</p></li>
                <li><p>Most professors return incomplete or incorrect proofs for revisions. This is an important part of the learning process; be comfortable with working through revisions several times. </p></li>
                <li><p>When writing about equations or formulas, remember that they exist and are not evolving or springing into being. Refer to them as factual entities that simply <em>are</em>. </p></li>
                <li><p>Writing in mathematics classes is generally done individually, while professionals may work solo, in pairs or small groups, and infrequently in large groups </p></li>
                <li><p>Many students find starting proofs challenging but, as with any piece of writing, it’s important to just start and not worry too much about being right immediately. Try strategies recommended by your professors, like starting with definitions of important terms or working backwards. </p></li>

			<title>Writing for Philosophy</title>
				<introduction>
					<p>Writing for philosophy is all about arguments.  Philosophy essays create a conversation between the arguments of others and the author's own arguments, for the purpose of answering a philosophical question. While somewhat similar in structure to papers in other disciplines, philosophy papers follow unique conventions. Read this section to learn how to write a top-notch paper for your philosophy class!</p>
				</introduction>
                <note>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, all italicized quotes throughout this section are excerpted from the interview with Philosophy faculty members at the University of Puget Sound that informed this section.</p>
        </note>
				<paragraphs>
					<title>Genres</title>
					<p><q><em>Have a question that you’re answering, look at a couple of different answers to that question, then explain what your answer is and why you’re not answering the question in other ways.</em></q></p>
					<p>The fundamental genre of philosophy is the argumentative essay. These are centered around a thesis that clearly states a position and develops a sustained argument for that position. In addition, philosophy papers have a few unique emphases. First, most papers include one or multiple counterarguments to the author’s claim. A good paper will fully explain these counterarguments and then defend against them; this should be a real section of the paper, not just an afterthought in the conclusion. Second, philosophy papers often use fewer sources than research papers in other disciplines. Using a few sources very fully and intentionally is much better than pulling in a lot of outside information in a cursory way. Finally, philosophy papers are often shorter than big research papers in other disciplines. However, this doesn’t mean that they are easier to write. Every sentence is important; a good paper might start at ten pages and be edited down to five. Papers in philosophy are generally single-authored, especially at the student level.</p>
				</paragraphs>
				<paragraphs>
					<title>Purpose</title>
					<p><q><em>Writing in philosophy... serves as a way of clarifying one's own views. Just going through that process of having to write it out helps people figure out what they believe.</em></q></p>
					<p>The purpose of writing in philosophy is to defend or clarify a philosophical position or view, contributing to a conversation that can take place across time and space. A good paper presents one or several existing positions on a topic, develops its own position, and responds to potential counterarguments. Writing in this field should be interesting and accessible to any intelligent reader, not just members of a specialized academic community. While potentially less complex, student papers serve this purpose in the same way a professional academic’s would.  Writing a philosophy paper can also serve to clarify your own thinking about an issue: the process of interrogating your argument and considering counterarguments can help you realize what you believe and why you believe it!</p>
				</paragraphs>
				<paragraphs>
					<title>Valued Characteristics</title>
					<p><q><em>You should be constantly telling me what you're going to do. Like this that you're discussing on page three... what exactly is that relation to what you said on page two? Make that as explicit as you can as opposed to allowing your reader to sort of guess.</em></q></p>
					<p>Again, writing for philosophy is all about making an argument. A very clear argumentative thesis is the most important part of your paper. Make sure you know what you’re arguing and sustain the argument throughout the paper, laying it out clearly for your reader. Clarity is one of the most important elements of a good philosophy paper. Philosophical ideas can be confusing; don’t make them more difficult by trying to use artsy language! Likewise, philosophy papers should be clearly organized and roadmapped. Don’t be afraid to tell the reader exactly what you’re going to argue in each paragraph. Phrases like <q>Now I will argue…</q> are great here. Carefully chosen examples also make your argument more clear.</p>
					<p>Creativity of thought is also valued in philosophy. Even if a text has been analyzed for centuries, think about novel perspectives you can bring to the conversation!</p>
					<p>A good paper almost always presents a charitable, comprehensive summary of the perspective of at least one author’s argument. Read the argument you’re using several times and make sure you can explain it clearly. Charitable analysis is key: don’t try to make the position weak so it’s easy to argue against. A more nuanced, challenging argument will make a better paper.</p>

					<title>Evidence</title>
					<p><q><em>It’s a matter of using sources to create this conversation, this dialectic.</em></q></p>
					<p>Use of evidence in philosophy papers can take several forms. Evidence can be textual, often in the form of explaining an argument written by another author. These arguments should be put in conversation with each other. While quotes are okay, a good explanation of an author’s argument is often best. Remember to cite properly and to clearly distinguish the point of view you are paraphrasing from your own.</p>
					<p>Empirical evidence<mdash/>such as for instance data from the fields of neuroscience or psychology<mdash/>can also be used to back up claims and support your argument. Avoid making broad claims about human nature without this kind of support. This form of evidence should also be cited.</p>
					<p>Philosophy values logical thought, so some forms of evidence that aren’t common in other disciplines are also valid. These include thought experiments or well-thought-out examples or counterexamples that provide proof for a point. These often won’t come from an outside source and don’t need to be cited.</p>
					<p>Again, using a few sources thoroughly and purposefully is better than picking facts from a wide number of sources.</p>

					<title>Conventions and Tips</title>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Clarity of language is valued over style. Don’t be afraid to use repetitive language if it’s the clearest way to state something.</p></li>
						<li><p>Clearly define any jargon you use.</p></li>
						<li><p>Carefully distinguish between your argument and others you introduce. Cite (see <xref ref="citations"/>)!</p></li>
						<li><p>Use of <q>I</q> is encouraged in philosophy papers, and helpful to distinguish between your argument or contribution and the other arguments you are using. Distinguishing your novel contribution from the arguments of others is key!</p></li>
						<li><p>Clearly roadmap your paper. Tell the reader <q>In this section I will be arguing . . .</q>, tell them <q>In this section I argued . . . .</q> Do all the work for them.</p></li>
						<li><p>In the same vein . . . use of subsections with headings is encouraged, especially for longer papers.</p></li>
						<li><p>The target audience for philosophy papers is an intelligent reader who is interested in philosophy but has no background on the topic. Your paper should make it clear and interesting to them.</p></li>
						<li><p>Engaging your reader in the introduction is important, but avoid cliches and broad sweeping statements.</p></li>
						<li><p>Outlines (see <xref ref="outlining"/>) and reverse outlines (see <xref ref="reverse-outlining"/>) are useful planning tools that will help confirm that your argument is cohesive!</p></li>

	<title>Writing for Spanish</title>
		<p>Writing in Spanish (or any foreign language) is difficult because you are expected to think critically about the subject of the paper while also mastering grammatical concepts and developing fluency. Though daunting, critical thinking about a variety of different topics actually helps writers master grammar (tenses, moods) and sentence construction and learn new vocabulary, meeting two objectives with one task! Read this guide to learn more about the skills you will need to write well in Spanish.</p>

        	<title>Genres</title>
        	<p>The type of writing Spanish students are asked to do varies by level<mdash/>100<ndash/> and 200<ndash/>level students typically write letters, summaries, and interpersonal communications, while upper-level students most often write literary and film analysis papers within Latin American and Spanish cultural contexts.</p>

        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-spanish-purpose">
        	<title>Purpose</title>
        	<p><q><em>We write in Spanish to practice the expression of ideas that leads to fluency.</em></q></p>
        	<p>Though the ultimate goal of writing in Spanish is to achieve fluency, it cannot be achieved without both the mastery of grammatical concepts and critical, original thinking about relevant topics. In other words, grammatical correctness and original expression are equally important. By encouraging writers to think about different topics and ideas that arise through reading literature in Spanish and watching films, writing assignments in Spanish help students become <q>speakers of Spanish<mdash/>who are prepared to speak their minds in any situation<mdash/>rather than linguists.</q></p>

        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-spanish-valued-characteristics">
        	<title>Valued Characteristics</title>
        	<p><q><em>Persuasion is not synonymous with categorical assertiveness. Spanish writers demonstrate more politeness and openness to perspectives than English writers.</em></q></p>
        	<p>Writers in Spanish are expected to dedicate an equal amount of time and space to a variety of viewpoints throughout a paper. In English, it is often accepted to have one paragraph or even one sentence that discusses and refutes opposing viewpoints, but this is not sufficient in Spanish. Nuance and close reading are key to achieving the kind of paper that devotes equal attention to a variety of viewpoints, but it is important to remember that everything must still relate back to the thesis. If an alternative viewpoint contradicts the thesis, the writer must also refute that viewpoint such that faithfulness to the thesis is maintained. </p>
        	<p>Don’t summarize. While a paper must demonstrate that a writer has closely read a text, writers must also offer insight beyond summarization of the plot. Like all academic writing, literary and film analysis papers in Spanish must add to an ongoing conversation about the text and themes– a summary offers nothing to add.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-spanish-evidence">
        	<title>Evidence</title>
        	<p><q><em>Writing in Spanish should be grounded in a close reading of the text [or film]. It should not use the text as a pre-text to talk about other things or what is happening in the world but should use the text as an object of analysis.</em></q></p>
        	<p>Evidence should be exclusively textual. While it may be tempting to use the text as a springboard to talk about the sociopolitical context of the time the text was written or about something that’s happening in the “real world”<mdash/>and while this is not only acceptable but highly valued in other disciplines<mdash/>papers in Spanish must remain grounded in the text. The text provides clues about themes that the author is thinking about, and the writer’s goal is to uncover these themes and defend them using those very clues from the text.</p>

        <paragraphs xml:id="writing-spanish-tips">
        	<title>Conventions and Tips</title>
        	<p><ul>
        		<li><p>Take cues from the conventions of the English department. Because English department papers usually also involve literary and film analysis, the expectations are often quite similar!</p></li>
        		<li><p>Accept a lack of sophistication while you approach fluency. Writing in a foreign language is difficult, so it’s ok to start simple! Papers can be written in short, simple sentences which can later be edited and combined to add nuance. Sentences in formal academic Spanish writing tend to be long with several subordinate clauses, but writers can always combine several short sentences to achieve this.</p></li>
        		<li><p>Translation is not the answer! Though online translation software is becoming more and more sophisticated, it cannot provide the kind of nuance that is required of Spanish writers and will prevent learning in the long run!</p></li>
        		<li><p>Write as if the reader has not read the text. While it is important to avoid summarizing, the more detail about the text you include, the better.</p></li>
        		<li><p>Don’t feel tied to the chronological order established by the text. Organize points thematically rather than chronologically if it makes more sense.</p></li>
        		<li><p>Maintain continuity of tense. Make sure all of the verbs in the paper are conjugated in the same tense. When discussing actions that happen in the plot of the text, the convention is to use the present tense.</p></li>
        		<li><p>For grammar concerns, identify patterns of consistent errors, and focus on correcting those. You might not catch every error you make, but by focusing on errors you make frequently, you’ll learn to avoid them over time.</p></li>

				<title>Writing for Geology</title>
				<p>While you may imagine geologists as a bunch of dirty scientists looking at rocks through hand lenses, geology, like every science, is all about storytelling and communication. Learning to write well for your geology classes will help you succeed in the field and convey your understanding of complex concepts. Read this guide to learn the key aspects of writing in geology!</p>

        			<title>Genres</title>
        			<p>Almost all writing for geology is technical scientific writing, but the form varies in different classes and assignments. Writing in class may be single-authored or collaborative. Most geological researchers publish collaboratively these days, so take advantage of your opportunities to learn collaborative writing skills! The audience can also vary: some pieces of writing should be accessible to a broad audience, while others are written for other geologists specifically. If you aren’t sure, ask your professor. </p>
        			<p>Many assignments will ask you to engage with primary literature. Literature review papers require you to survey relevant literature on a specific topic, summarize papers, and then <em>synthesize</em> how papers interact to draw conclusions about the field. Shorter article review assignments will also require synthesis and analysis, but of just one journal article. In upper-division classes you may also write National Science Foundation-style grant proposals, where you review literature in the field and then use it to propose a novel research project.</p>
        			<p>Some writing assignments will also be sharing research that you did yourself. These could be as short as writing a results section based on a lab exercise or as long as a full journal-article-style piece about summer research. Along with grant proposals, articles disseminating new research are the most common form of writing for academic professionals in the field.</p>

        			<p><q><em>Even hardcore geochemistry can be made accessible by establishing context... remember that you are telling a story about Earth's history.</em></q></p>
        			<p>The purpose of most writing for your geology class is to convey your understanding of knowledge in the field and refine technical writing skills you’ll use as a geologist. For lab or research writing, you are also presenting new information in the context of existing literature. Using your writing to make connections with literature is critical. Professional academic geologists write to disseminate their research and put it in the context of larger inquiries in the field.</p>

        			<p><q><em>Focus on clarity in your technical or scientific writing since often what you're trying to convey is potentially very complicated or confusing.</em></q></p>
        			<p>Like all scientists, geologists value clarity and concision. Work to master the skill of distilling potentially confusing concepts into words that make sense to any reader! This won’t always be easy; be sure to have others read over your work. Use headings and sections to make longer papers more approachable to the reader.</p>
        			<p>Using primary literature appropriately is very important (see next section). Make connections between the work you’re doing and the literature, or between different articles that you read. This synthesis is really important: how does literature in the field build or contradict? How have methods or core research topics changed over time? What conclusions about your topic does this lead to? Finally, remember that science is storytelling! Be sure to zoom out and connect your work to the big picture of our planet’s past and present.</p>

        			<title>Evidence</title>
        			<p><q><em>Find the original source, even if that means going back to 1927.</em></q></p>
        			<p>Valid evidence for geology writing is usually peer-reviewed journal articles or data you collected in a lab or research project. When you cite data, it’s important that it was collected with up-to-date technology and methodology. Remember that any statement of fact you make needs to be cited! This gives credibility to your statements in addition to not being plagiarism.</p>
        			<p>Looking through the literature thoroughly is key, especially for grant proposals or lit review assignments. Search for any important original landmark papers on the topic you’re researching, even if they’re old. Then, look over all articles from the last ten years or so and all the most frequently cited articles from the last twenty years. These exact date ranges may vary for different topics, but your professor will be able to tell if you actually reviewed the literature or picked the first studies you could find at random. Additionally, if you’re going to cite a piece of information, use reference sections to find where it originally came from. Don’t cite a 2004 study for a piece of data that has been recycled 5 times and actually comes from 1955! If a fact is presented in the introduction, it usually came from somewhere else (again, you can use the references to find it). </p>
