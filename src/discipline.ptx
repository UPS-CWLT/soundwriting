        <title>Writing for Business</title>
        <p>Business is a social science, making it part of a distinct group of disciplines that use scientific methods to study individual and social behavior. Among these disciplines, business is uniquely oriented towards the professional world outside of purely academic domains. Its professional focus can be unfamiliar and can sometimes disconcert new writers. Read through these guidelines to get a better idea of how to write for business!</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>The typical genres you'll be writing in for business are short memos<mdash/>in which you will brief your audience with the relevant and pressing facts of a situation<mdash/>and case studies, which consist of three parts: an introduction in which you will provide appropriate historical and contextual information about a business or company, a strategic analysis section in which you will identify and analyze structural and organizational problems with that business or company, and a final section in which you will recommend solutions for those problems. Other typical genres include position papers in which you will present a disputable issue from one side, research papers for which you will research a topic and present that research to support a thesis, literature reviews in which you will summarize and analyze secondary sources relevant to a specific topic, and personal reflections.</p>

            <p><q><em>Writing is used in decision making.</em></q><fn>Unless otherwise indicated, all quotes come from faculty in the department interviews that inform the advice given here.</fn></p>
            <p>The purpose of writing for business classes isn't exactly the same as the purpose of writing in the professional business world: classes are specifically designed for you to practice and improve your writing skills whereas the professional world is often more results oriented. For this reason, academic papers are generally more focused and less broad than professional ones so that you will have enough time to do a thorough job. Despite the difference between class and the professional world you should treat the business essays you write as though they were directed at a real professional audience. Accordingly, because your imagined audience is practicing professionals, it's important to remember that, whereas in most other disciplines you are only trying to persuade someone to <em>believe</em> something, in business you are trying to persuade someone to believe something <em>so that they will do something</em>. You can think of your writing as a tool you can use to have a direct impact on a person, company or government's actions.</p>

            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>Don't make your reader do the work. You need to do all the work.</em></q></p>
            <p>Writing for business should be as direct, simple, concise, and accurate as possible<mdash/>don't use too many adjectives or try to sound poetic. Although this spare style of writing may feel impersonal, there are very important reasons to use it. The writing done for business in the professional world is used directly in decision making. In consequence, the conventions of business writing are oriented towards informing your reader so that they can make their decision as accurately and efficiently as possible. By being direct and simple, you allow your audience to understand the situation and ideas you are describing while simultaneously making it clear to that audience that you understand the situation and are a competent source. By being concise, you show that you are efficient and that you value your readers' time, and by being accurate you show your reader that you are willing to be honest and realistic.</p>
            <p>Further, within these guidelines there is room to be creative: an important part of business writing is innovation. In the last part of many business papers (such as case studies) you will be asked to suggest possible solutions to the problem or question you've outlined in the body of your paper. This is a place in your writing where you get to think innovatively about the possible futures and outcomes of various choices and present your ideas about how best to implement strategies to ensure the best possible future. In this part of your writing it's particularly important to be value neutral: these possible solutions are not about what a person <em>should</em> do; these possible solutions are about what a person or company <em>can</em> do.</p>

            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p>When you're providing evidence in a business paper, the kinds of evidence you'll want to rely on will come largely from peer-reviewed publications. In business scenarios, quantifiable evidence is usually the most persuasive, so using figures and situating data in its dated time period are key to building a reliable, accurate argument.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>Proofread your paper for spelling and grammar. While grammar may seem less important to some writers, imagine that you are a business executive sending an email to your staff. If the email you send has spelling errors in the first sentence you could lose credibility and professionalism in the eyes of your readers.</p></li>
                <li><p>You can use subheadings to organize your papers! While subheadings are discouraged in some disciplines, feel free to use them for business papers to add extra clarity and formality.</p></li>
                <li><p>Don't use clichés or contractions. And while personal pronouns are okay, don't start a sentence with <q>I think.</q> While these rules may seem overly fastidious, it's important to follow them so that your writing is both professional and reflective of your own distinctive voice. Using clichés is counterproductive to both of these values because they aren't your own words and they are not particularly professional. Further, starting a sentence with <q>I think</q> can sound demure rather than convincing.</p></li>

        <title>Writing for Chemistry</title>
        <p>Writing can sometimes seem like an obstacle for science students. Within scientific culture, the importance of effective communication is often underemphasized. This under emphasis leads many students entering college to see science writing as, at best, a necessary evil, and at worst, a tangled skein of jargon and arbitrary formatting. So far from being true, the exact opposite is the case. In the wise words of Professor Steven Neshyba <q>science is in the communication. Science doesn't exist in someone's head. The science <em>is</em> the communication.</q> To learn more about how to be an effective science writer, read this guide!</p>

            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>Writing in chemistry is challenging for new students since there are many different types of writing in chemistry. However, most of these genres can be broken down into a shared set of sections, each with its own distinctive style and purpose: a title, an abstract, an introduction, an experimental section, a results section, a discussion, a conclusion, and a literature cited. Together, these sections make up the most fundamental genre in chemistry writing: research articles (<ie/>, lab reports). Further, these sections also make up the research posters, review articles, and research proposals you'll be introduced to in upper-level classes. The only kind of writing in chemistry not made up by these sections is the notes you'll take in your laboratory notebook.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p>The purpose of chemistry writing depends on the genre. A lab notebook is meant to be fairly informal, but clear and detailed enough that another chemist unfamiliar with the experiment you're doing could open up your notebook and repeat the experiment. Keeping this kind of detailed record of your lab work will allow you to go back later and understand what it was you did in lab. In turn, understanding what you did will give you the context you need to write an informed lab report and thus make the process much easier.</p>
            <p>These lab reports are formal papers that are meant to be places for you to practice sorting through, presenting and analyzing data. Further, lab reports also give you practice deepening your understanding of what you did in lab by allowing you to see your knowledge gaps and fill them by looking things up or asking your classmates and professor. Last but not least, lab reports are the avenues of communicating your results to faculty and other scientists, making them the crucial places where science really occurs.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>Brevity may be the soul of wit, but it is the cerebrum of good science writing.</em></q></p>
            <p>When you write for chemistry, be clear, concise, and precise. In art, ambiguity is often ripe with meaning, but in scientific writing ambiguity is distracting. One of the most common writing errors chemistry students make is being vague when they should be precise. Don't say <q>the product was obtained in good yield</q> when you could just as easily say <q>the aldehyde 3 was obtained in <quantity><mag>64</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> yield,</q> a statement that contains much more useful information for other scientists trying to replicate your experiment.</p>
            <p>Despite the importance of clarity, being precise shouldn't prevent you from telling a story with your data: structuring a lab report as a narrative is a higher-level skill that can turn a seemingly mundane paper into a compelling one. Your Title provides a hook to draw in the reader; then the Introduction sets the narrative background and poses the problem that needs solving; the Experimental and Results sections show how your protagonist has interrogated nature, and the answers they have gained; and then the Discussion shows what the results mean and how they resolve the original problem.  Of course there are often questions left unanswered, or new questions that arose in the course of the work; these then appear at the end of the Discussion to entice the reader to look for the sequel (that is, the reader's own subsequent research).</p>

            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p><q><em>A figure saves a thousand words.</em></q></p>
            <p>Evidence in chemistry<mdash/>as in all natural sciences<mdash/>is exclusively empirical, reproducible data from experiments you have done yourself or from a peer-reviewed, scholarly source. As the quote marking this subsection suggests, it can be very helpful to organize your results and explain the context you give in your introduction using figures and tables. These tables and figures are a powerful way to harness your evidence if you pair them with descriptive captions and embed them in the text of your lab report. That said, figures and tables don't <em>replace</em> words: don't include a figure if you don't explain it in text!</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <list>
            <title>Conventions and Tips</title>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Don't write from beginning to end. Many students think they should write a report in the order that it appears, but this is often an inefficient way to write a research paper<mdash/>the abstract comes immediately after the title, but it should normally be written last, because it is easier to summarize the research after you've written the entire report and have thus refined your understanding of the research. Although there is no one-size-fits-all approach, here is an order that is usually effective: Organize your thoughts and your data, write the Experimental Section, prepare the important illustrations (<ie/>, Tables, Figures, and Schemes), write the Results section (using the illustrations as a guide), draft an outline of the Discussion section, write the Introduction, complete the Discussion Section, write the Conclusions, add References, write the Title and Abstract.</p></li>
                <li><p>Start early and get help if needed. Usually professors won't have time to go over your whole draft, so make sure you go into office hours or send an email with a few specific questions for them to answer.</p></li>
                <li><p>Know your audience. You are writing for other chemists with a similar level of knowledge to your own but who are not familiar with the exact experiments you performed. You don't have to go into gory detail about procedures that any chemist should know<mdash/>it is even OK to use a little jargon if it is part of the chemist's lexicon.  For example, <q>the reaction was heated at reflux for 2 hours</q> is perfectly clear to any chemist who has taken organic chemistry.</p></li>
                <li><p>Delete superfluous words: don't say <q>the melting point <em>was determined to be</em> 198<ndash/><quantity><mag>199</mag><unit base="degreeCelsius"/></quantity>,</q> say <q>the melting point <em>is</em> 198<ndash/><quantity><mag>199</mag><unit base="degreeCelsius"/></quantity>.</q></p></li>
                <li><p>Chemical names are not capitalized (unless they are trade names).</p></li>
                <li><p>All manuscripts should be double-spaced (unless told otherwise).</p></li>
                <li><p>Use the proper number of significant figures when reporting data.</p></li>
                <li><p>Always put a space between a number and its units.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use the correct citation style.</p></li>
                <li><p>Write in pen in your lab notebook. You'll find out why, if you spill something!</p></li>

        <title>Writing for English</title>
        <p>Many students entering college have an idea of what writing for an English class should be like: while most students haven't taken a psychology or <init>STS</init> class, the majority of students have taken several English classes before college and have prior experience writing English papers. Depending on their experiences, students may believe that English writing is congenitally phony and imprecise because it is founded on subjective opinions rather than facts and that <q>there are no right answers.</q> Alternately, students may think that English papers are brittle five-paragraph essays that impoverish the texts that they analyze. While these assumptions can be hard to displace, English essays are neither unsubstantiated opinions nor life-sucking exercises in pedantry. Rather, English papers can be powerful transformations of your impressions and emotions regarding a text into analysis that reveals the more profound underpinnings of a story. Read this guide to get an idea of how to get the most out of writing for English!</p>

            <title>Genres</title>
            <p><q><em>Close reading is the meat and potatoes<mdash/>or the tofu and seitan<mdash/>of what we do.</em></q></p>
            <p>Although you'll be asked to write in scads of different genres for your English classes, close readings are the foundation on which all English writing rests. Close readings are essentially papers that ask you to move beyond saying that something exists in a text (for instance, alliteration), or is being used in a text, to <em>how</em> it's used, what it suggests in relation to other elements of the text, and why that matters. Longer papers in English classes can take the form of open-ended research papers, analysis of the relationships between a text and its historical moment, or quote analysis; however, these longer papers are essentially extended close readings around which you will have developed a theoretical framework. Other genres in English include many kinds of creative writing such as personal essays, memoirs and poetry, as well as book reviews or letters. You may be asked to write in these creative genres in traditional English classes as well as creative writing English classes.</p>

            <p><q><em>We are not teaching, for the most part, content, as much as we're teaching habits of mind and skills. <ellipsis/> We are asking students to become practitioners of the genres and the forms that we ourselves work in.</em></q></p>
            <p>The purpose of writing in English classes is to become a better writer and a better reader. In your English classes your professors don't want you to put on an analytic production just for the professor's eyes, rather, you are being asked to take a step in a larger series of conversations that will allow you to practice habits of mind and transferable analytical skills. Hopefully these habits of mind will include a deeper appreciation for the profound and subtle ways language shapes our imagined realities as well as how our own theoretical biases affect how we read a text.</p>

            <p><q><em>Show me that I'm progressing. <ellipsis/> I want to feel like I'm learning with the paper.</em></q></p>
            <p>Writing for English, perhaps more so than any other discipline, emphasizes the process or craft of an essay rather than the product. This emphasis is inherent to the discipline because English is so consummately qualitative: you are not presenting quantitative data or known observations and conclusions. Rather you are making a qualitative analysis that puts your data (your textual observations) into a meaningful pattern and then commenting on the overall meaning or effect of that pattern. In this way, the form of an English essay is just as important as its content: <em>how</em> you have organized your ideas and presented them is just as important as the ideas themselves. For this reason English papers should not be like lists of evidence, rather they should show the development of an argument over the course of an essay, with each paragraph acting as a logical advance is the progress of the argument.</p>
            <p>Because the writer's process of thought is so important to the English essay, your professors will tell you that good reading is the beginning of good writing and that the process of good reading is itself good thinking: how you read will be reflected in how you write<mdash/>meaning that to be able to write well you yourself must think critically, take notes and make observations while you read instead of merely absorbing the words on the page.</p>
            <p>One of aspect of English essays that can be a stumbling block to students is actually the thing that can make it so rewarding: far from having a single correct answer, texts have a multitude of possible solutions and interpretations. Because there is no absolute, definitive interpretation, many students can be caught in the difference between opinions and arguments: sometimes it can feel unnerving to make an interpretive leap because you think that it isn't <quantity><mag>100</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity> certain<mdash/>but that's actually the nature of the claims we make as English writers: while they are substantiated, they are fundamentally arguable. An arguable claim is different from an opinion in that arguments are substantiated by textual evidence while opinions are not.</p>

            <p>Evidence in English is almost exclusively textual, however textual evidence is not <q>evidence</q> in itself! When you include textual evidence it should be because its specific language or mechanical aspects are <q>meaningful in a way that is irreducible.</q> However the meaning that you see in the textual evidence is not self-evident: when you include textual evidence you must always use your own words to explain what part and how it is meaningful to your argument.</p>

        <title>Writing for History</title>
        <p>Among scholars, historians are unique in their pursuit of knowledge from pasts that only get further away rather than clearer as time goes on. The difficulty of sometimes vast amounts of elapsed time combined with the intense and often bewildering particularity of different historical moments can make writing academically about history challenging for students. Read this guide to get an idea of how to think about your task as a historian-in-training!</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>Of the several kinds of writing you will be asked to do in your History classes, close readings of a primary source are perhaps the most foundational. A close reading is a paper in which you develop an analytical argument that takes into account the historical context the source is from. The skills you use to write a primary source close reading are transferable to the secondary source critiques that you will be asked to write. Another way to think of these critiques is as a way to <q>test other scholars</q> by asking how it is that are they are arguing and by breaking that down for your reader. Other history papers include papers that put primary and secondary sources in conversation with one another, annotated bibliographies, research prospectuses and comparisons of a historian's versus a popular source's version of an event to elucidate the difference between how historians and how others think about the past.</p>

            <p><q><em><brackets>The purpose</brackets> is two-fold: firstly writing is a creative process, so we figure things out as we write, <ellipsis/> but the end goal is to understand the people of the past and why they did things the way they did.</em></q></p>
            <p>Unlike writing in many other academic disciplines, most good historical writing is open and accessible to the general reader. Part of the purpose of historical writing, then, is to bring the stories and patterns of the past to the attention of modern readers. Within these stories and patterns are the figures of the past. These figures can sometimes seem very strange, they can seem evil, they can seem funny, but they are ultimately human beings and your task as a historian is to make sense of them from their perspectives to the extent to which that's possible<mdash/>and it's a task that is, in fact impossible, and that's part of what you can love about it: your job is to try to make sense of a puzzle, always knowing that you can't quite get there.</p>

            <title>Valued Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>Imagination is really important. <sq>Analytical</sq> for us isn't like looking through a microscope, but having to really imagine, and being willing to think about things in new ways.</em></q></p>
            <p>Writing for history can be very difficult because you are, in essence, being asked to disregard what you know<mdash/>what your present has taught you<mdash/>and recreate a world that you have never seen and that has ceased existing. For this reason, historical writing is an act of inquiry that is both logical and imaginative. To be a good historian you must begin by making observations and then use these observations to ask good questions that will help you reimagine the past in a new way or to find the gaps in existing ways of understanding it. These questions and new ways of seeing will allow you to gain a deeper knowledge of the past and, hopefully, a deeper empathy for its figures.</p>
            <p>A second important part of writing historically is understanding that making a historical argument does not mean disregarding your sources to write what you want, rather, it means to allow your observations to help you make a convincing argument by presenting them in the truest possible way: historians feel they have an ethical responsibility to not abuse their evidence, to not do violence to the sources of the past, to not force a source to say something that it did not intend to say. For this reason, when you make an interpretive leap you must justify it so that you do not misrepresent a source.</p>
            <p>This second characteristic of historical writing is often called being value neutral. However, being value neutral doesn't mean that historians don't see things as right and wrong<mdash/>instead it means that in order to actually be able to distinguish one from the other a historian must first begin by understanding the people of the past<mdash/>and you can't do that unless you have put aside your own moral lens long enough to figure them out. Putting aside your lenses is, indeed the thing that will allow you to ask the questions you will need to ask in order to imagine the past<mdash/>questions that are not merely factual, that are not anachronistic or judgmental, but analytical.</p>

        <title>Writing for Psychology</title>
        <p>As a social science, psychology presents unique challenges to student writers: it can be difficult to navigate between quantitative scientific data and the ineluctably qualitative arguments that you'll need to make about human behavior. Read this guide to get a better idea of what it's important to focus on while writing for psychology!</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>There are two main kinds of writing in psychology. The first is research reports in which you will convey to your audience the research you have done, the reason you did it, what method you did it by, and the results and conclusions you arrive at. The second type of writing you will do is literature reviews, in which you will write papers focused on canvassing a particular area of research to generate new conclusions about that area. Another type of writing you may be asked to do that is less common is translational writing in which you will be asked to <q>translate</q> scientific writing for general audiences.</p>

            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p><q><em>If your grandmother is a reasonably smart person and she's still alive and she's never majored in psychology, and if she can't understand your paper from beginning to end, there's probably something wrong with it.</em></q></p>
            <p>Because the purpose of writing is psychology is, at its most fundamental level to make a good and meaningful difference in the lives of people, it is paramount that your writing is understandable. In order to promote meaningful change in people's lives, you must first be able to communicate the findings of your empirical study effectively to both other scientists and larger audiences.</p>

            <p><q><em>The goal is to be honest.</em></q></p>
            <p>Because psychology is a science and psychological writing is used to change how individuals and societies think about and treat others, it is crucial that arguments are made honestly and using empirical data. In your essays it's therefore important that you prioritize presenting your data fairly over pushing your own interpretation the data. Instead, while you make your argument you should allow room for alternate explanations: be honest about what you know and what you don't know and recognize the limitations of your argument.</p>
            <p>In your attempt to be as honest as possible with your findings, you will be aided by being precise and concise rather than ambiguous and flowery. It is difficult to be straightforward if your writing is confusing or vague about what your results actually are and how you obtained them.</p>
            <p>While presenting the facts of your research clearly and plainly is vital, it is equally important to <q>go beyond the data</q> by writing about its applied relevance in interdisciplinary and ethical spaces.</p>

            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p><q><em>In psychology you can almost never see the thing you want to know <ellipsis/></em></q></p>
            <p>Because psychology is a social science, the data you use should be empirical rather than textual. For this reason, a theory from a secondary source is not evidence, and most professors discourage the use of quotes. However, while psychological data is scientific, <em>how</em> you interpret it is inherently qualitative. While in the natural sciences if, for example, you want to know the temperature at which something melts, you can take a thermometer and watch and see when it melts and you'll know the answer: you can observe the things you want to know about directly. In psychology you can almost never see the thing you want to know about because it's inside a person. For example you could have an idea that a pharmaceutical increases hunger and then, when you give this pharmaceutical to people they eat more. Did the pharmaceutical increase hunger? Possibly. That's a good possible explanation for what happened, but you didn't see hunger, you just saw eating and you have to make a link between what you saw (which was people eating) and the underlying thing you think is in there (which is hunger). In this way, while the data you collect are wholly scientific, the way you choose to explain that evidence is, by nature, conjectural.</p>

                <li><p>Psychology writing operates on the sometimes subtle differentiation between broad generalizations and possible explanations.

                <li><p>Writing in psychology seeks to de-emphasize the <q>who</q> and instead focus on the <q>what.</q> For this reason don't <q>call on experts</q> or name-drop the authors of your secondary sources in text as you would in other disciplines.  Cite them, but don't introduce them formally.</p></li>

        <title>Writing for Biology</title>
        <p>There is a collective dread around writing in the natural sciences. Some science students believe that writing is not important to science or are insecure about their ability to communicate. Because of these prior beliefs, the prospect of writing the epic length, highly regimented lab reports and papers required by many biology classes can be daunting for many students. However, lab reports, while not always a walk in the park, are actually vital to understanding the context and the relevance of the science you are doing in lab and learning about in class. Read this guide to learn about how writing for biology can be helpful and meaningful to you!</p>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Genres</title>
            <p>As in most science classes, the vast majority of the writing you do will be in the form of lab reports. Lab reports are papers based on an investigation that follows the standard template of an introduction, a methods section, a presentation of results and a discussion of those results. In most biology classes you will be asked to write both full-length lab reports as well as individual sections of one for practice. Other kinds of writing that you may be asked to do include abstracts, critical reviews (in which you synthesize the primary literature on a topic) or, in upper division classes, research proposals, mock grant proposals, and research papers.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Purpose</title>
            <p><q><em>We spend so much time in lab on the methods portion and results portion, but lab reports are really helpful because they make us step out and investigate the field.</em></q></p>
            <p>It's entirely too easy to become myopic in lab (both figuratively and literally<mdash/>goggles don't help anyone's eyesight). Because of this possibility, lab reports become not only effective ways to communicate the results of an experiment to other scientists, but also good places to help you understand the science you have done more fully and in the context of biology as a disciple. Further, while the prescribed format may seem ponderous, there is a reason why it has lasted: it can help you organize your own thoughts and give you the space to <q>step back</q> and find the larger frame for your experiment. In this way, rather than onerous tasks, lab reports are actually great opportunities to rethink what you've done in lab and learned in class on your own and to understand the larger import of the experiment you conducted.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Traits and Characteristics</title>
            <p><q><em>I like to think of science almost like a coral reef you can build on: you build on what's beneath.</em></q></p>
            <p>The purpose of doing an experiment is never just to have done the experiment; rather, as the quote marking this subsection indicates, the purpose of a lab is not to repeat something already known but to build innovatively on what you've learned, allowing you to explore the emergent properties of scientific knowledge. This idea is particularly important to remember when you're writing for biology because writing in biology requires that you frame any experimental description with the <q>why</q> behind your research.</p>
            <p>Further, because biology is a natural science, it adheres to the principles of the scientific method, requiring objectivity, reproducibility and quantitative results. For these reasons it's important to communicate clearly and efficiently in a style that reflects this objectivity and relies on quantitative values rather than vague words like <q>more</q> or <q>greater.</q></p>
            <p>While it may seem like there's a convention-driven style to a lot of science writing in which you follow established norms, a good scientist thinks creatively about the field, where the gaps are, and where they can contribute. Thus, although lab reports may feel unreasonably dry and restrictive, there is always room within the individual sections and their connecting links to explain ideas in an innovative way, ask creative questions and propose new ideas for future research.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Evidence</title>
            <p>Because biology is a natural science, the only kind of data you should use is empirical, reproducible data you have collected yourself or data from a peer-reviewed, secondary source published in a scholarly journal. Quoting is generally discouraged, although there are exceptions for research papers, proposals or grants.</p>
        </paragraphs>

            <title>Conventions and Tips</title>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Don't write your paper in the order it's presented to you in the template. It's easier to reverse-engineer your paper by starting with figures, tables and the procedure and results sections and then working your way through the discussion, finishing with your title and introduction. This approach will allow you to focus the information that you include in your introduction so that it is relevant to the rest of the experiment rather than wasting time writing about things that aren't relevant.</p></li>
                <li><p>Rely on the formatting given to you by your professors. Specifically ask your professor about whether they prefer active or passive voice<mdash/>this issue is still up for debate in science writing, and different professors (and different branches of the field) have different policies.</p></li>
