        <title>Top 5 differences between written and spoken (or signed!) language</title>
        <ol>
            <li><p>The obvious difference (excluding the modern inventions of radio, telephones, and television): written language allows people to communicate across time and space, while spoken language happens immediately and is available only for those who can hear it (or see it, in the case of sign languages).</p></li>
            <li><p>Virtually every human being learns to speak, while literacy is far less common. Today, almost 17<percent/> of adults around the world are illiterate.</p></li>
            <li><p>Because reading and writing are consciously learned behaviors while the ability to speak is acquired naturally, many scientists and linguists think that spoken language is innate and written language is a human construct.</p></li>
            <li><p>Spoken and signed languages can have varieties and dialects, while written language is generally more regulated and standardized.</p></li>
            <li><p>Writing and speaking appear to use different parts of the brain.</p></li>

        <title>Differences in dialectual/cultural rules</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>Communication extends far beyond the grammatical features used by a speaker or writer. A person's grammar may be technically correct, but the meaning of their words can provoke anger, laughter, misunderstanding, or outright confusion. Since language revolves around <em>context</em>, knowing the context in which you speak or write is essential to producing culturally appropriate messages. In linguistics, the study of these cultural and contextual language rules is called <term>pragmatics</term>.</p>
            <p>Consider this example: you've decided to take your six-year-old cousin to the park for a picnic. You notice that a woman nearby is very pregnant. Your cousin also notices the person's large belly and decides to walk up to her and say, <q>Wow! You must have eaten a lot of treats!</q> Although your cousin's sentence is grammatically correct, they have made the significant English pragmatic mistake of talking about someone's body and consumption. Maybe your young cousin heard their parent say this same sentence to the robust family dog but has not yet learned that speaking to humans in such a way is inappropriate.</p>
            <p>Another example would be one of pragmatic differences between languages: a Caribbean student studying in the United States turns in a narrative and receives a poor grade. The teacher's comments point to an unorganized, illogical sequence of events within the narrative. However, what the teacher sees as unorganized and illogical is actually a culturally-distinct method of storytelling that is different from the standard method <xref ref="SAE">Standard American English</xref> uses.</p>
            <p>Here are some more pragmatic facts:</p>
        </introduction>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Other examples of pragmatic knowledge include knowing how and when to take turns speaking, making eye contact, and asking questions or asking for clarification.</p></li>
            <li><p>Contributing relevant information to a conversation that is not redundant or repetitive and adjusting the type of language based on the conversational situation constitute other types of pragmatic knowledge.</p></li>
            <li><p>Things like eye contact, head nodding, personal space, and amount of touching are also part of the pragmatics of a language and vary by language and culture.</p></li>
            <li><p>There are three main aspects of communication that are essential to understanding the pragmatic situation of a conversation: 1) the literal meaning of what was spoken (locution), 2) the speaker's intentions (illocution), and 3) the listener's interpretation (perlocution).</p></li>
            <li><p>Pragmatics is one major reason why it has been so difficult to program computers to speak and understand language. Try telling a robot to <q>crack a window,</q> and see what happens!</p></li>

        <title>Top 20 Things about Language that You Should Know as a Citizen of the World</title>
        <ol>
            <li><p>There are currently around 7,000 languages spoken in the world.</p></li>
            <li><p>A language dies every 14 days.</p></li>
            <li><p>The United States doesn't have an official language!</p></li>
            <li><p>Although English has become the dominant language used to communicate on a global scale, English ranks second in terms of number of speakers. Mandarin is first.</p></li>
            <li><p>The United States has the second largest Spanish-speaking population in the world. Mexico is the first.</p></li>
            <li><p>In spite of the fact that American English and British English are similar, American Sign Language and British Sign Language are actually quite different<mdash/>so much so that ASL and BSL speakers would not be able to understand each other. ASL is more closely related to French Sign Language (LSF).</p></li>
            <li><p>Half to two-thirds of people are to some extent bilingual.</p></li>
            <li><p>One of the world's leading linguists, Noam Chomsky, established a theory of universal grammar that holds that human linguistic capabilities are innate. It is argued that this innateness is the reason for which children acquire language without any overt instruction and also why all languages have the same foundational components (phonology, semantics, and syntax).</p></li>
            <li><p>24 different dialects of English are spoken across the United States.</p></li>
            <li><p>English is the official language of 67 countries.</p></li>
            <li><p>English is also the official language of the skies (i.e. among pilots and air traffic controllers).</p></li>
            <li><p>The concept of standardized, <q>correct</q> spellings of words came about only fairly recently due to the creation of dictionaries.</p></li>
            <li><p>Have you ever wondered why people in old American movies and TV shows spoke so strangely? It's called the mid-Atlantic or Transatlantic accent!</p></li>
            <li><p>English might lose its status as an official language of the European Union (EU) after the United Kingdom leaves the EU.</p></li>
            <li><p>If you want to learn more about languages of the world, check out this website: <url href="https://www.ethnologue.com/world"/>.</p></li>
            <li><p>There's a difference between <em>language</em> and <em>speech</em>. <em>Language</em> refers to the ways in which meaning is conveyed through words and their arrangements. <em>Speech</em> describes the physical act of speaking, including the acts of breathing, making noises, and articulating sounds correctly and with the right timing. The distinctions between language and speech are especially important when thinking about and working with language and speech disorders (i.e. is someone unable to communicate effectively because it's difficult for them to construct a "correct" sentence according to their language, or is it because they are physically unable to form the sounds of their language?).</p></li>

            <li><p>Here are some really cool TED talks about language: <url href="https://www.ted.com/topics/language"/></p></li>
            <li><p>A recent study published in the Journal for the Acoustical Society of America found evidence for the hypothesis that the geographical features of an area (e.g., sparse or dense forestation) likely influenced features of language(s) developed and spoken in those regions.</p></li>

        <title>Fun facts about the history of spoken and written language</title>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Date estimates for the origin of spoken language range from 50,000 years ago to as long as 2 million years ago.</p></li>
            <li><p>When the Paris Linguistic Society was formed (1866), its members weren't allowed to speculate about the origin of language.</p></li>
            <li><p>The world's oldest writing system, cuneiform, was developed by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia around 3500 BCE. Some systems of written communication existed before this time, which included different kinds of symbolic representations, but they are not considered written language because they cannot communicate complex ideas.</p></li>
            <li><p>Historians differentiate between prehistory and history by noting whether or not a civilization had written language.</p></li>
            <li><p>Chinese is the oldest writing system that is still in use.</p></li>
            <li><p>Newborns' vocal tracts resemble those of most non-human primates. Not until 6<ndash/>8 years into development are children's vocal tracts distinctly human.</p></li>

                <p>Remember that there are differences between written and spoken language! Although you hear the word <q>of</q> when you say this, what you're actually saying is <q>ve</q><mdash/>the last half of <q>have.</q> Because the sounds are the same when spoken and therefore the meaning of the phrase is unobstructed, it's easy to forget the distinction while writing. But, since written language requires the distinction to retain the meaning of the sentence (imagine being a confused English Language Learner reading <q>could of</q>), writers instead use the contraction <q>could've.</q></p>

                <p>Maybe just forget about this one. (Just kidding<mdash/>kind of.) Despite being such a wonderful thing, the act of lying (laying?) down can cause a world of pain when trying to write about it. The crucial thing you must determine is what (or who) is doing the laying/lying: (1) Is someone or something lying down on their own? (2) Or is someone laying something (or someone) else down?</p>
                <p>Present tense:<ul>

                <p>Seems easy enough, but, unfortunately, it gets more confusing.</p>
                <p>Past tense:<ul>
                    <li><p>Lie <m>\rightarrow</m> lay = <q>You lay down too often.</q></p></li>

                <p>Possessives in English are the worst! <q>Who's</q> seems like it would denote possession because it has an apostrophe, which is how we usually indicate that someone has something (with the exception of possessive pronouns like hers, his, theirs, and yours, of course<ellipsis/>). But, unfortunately, <q>who's</q> is a contraction of <q>who is</q> or <q>who has</q> and it has nothing to do with possession.</p>
                <p>
                    Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q>Who's that over there?</q> <m>\rightarrow</m> <q>Who is that over there?</q></p></li>
                        <li><p><q>She's the one who's been helping me.</q> <m>\rightarrow</m> <q>She is the one who has been helping me.</q></p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><q>Whose,</q> on the other hand, indicates that someone, <q>who,</q> possesses something. If you're a fan of early 2000s American comedy, you might use <em>Whose Line is it Anyway?</em> as a mnemonic device.</p>
                <p>
                    Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><q>Whose baby is that?</q> <m>\rightarrow</m> <q>To whom does that baby belong?</q></p></li>
                        <li><p><q>My friend, whose bike was stolen, decided to buy a U-lock.</q> <m>\rightarrow</m> <q>My friend, who possessed a bike that was stolen, decided to buy a U-lock.</q></p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Speaking of possessive pronouns<ellipsis/></p>
                <p>Similarly to <q>who's</q> looking like the possessive version of <q>who</q>, the possessive versions of the pronouns <q>it, him, her, your, their, and our</q> can be misleading. Although the apostrophe (it's, her's, your's, their's, and our's) is tempting to include, leave it out! The correct possessive pronouns are: its, his, hers, yours, theirs, and ours.</p>

                <p>Where do commas and periods go when you're using quotation marks?</p>
                <p>In <xref ref="SAE">Standard American English</xref>, commas and periods go inside <q>quotation marks.</q> The exception to this guideline is for some citation styles, like MLA, which <q>look like this</q> (page number).</p>
