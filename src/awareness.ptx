    <title>Writing with Awareness</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>While the impacts of language on individual feelings and circumstances may seem insignificant (<q>sticks and stones,</q> as the adage goes), language can embody prejudice, discrimination, and hierarchies. As do people and societies, words too have histories. Therefore, using words rooted in hate and oppression merely perpetuates such hate and oppression, and ultimately denies groups of people the opportunities to reclaim their individual and collective agency. However, if you are unfamiliar with such histories, it can sometimes be difficult to identify terminologies of oppression; some words, such as racial slurs, are overtly bigoted, while others more subtly express longstanding negative beliefs about particular groups of people. Similarly, patronizing and parochial treatment of specific languages or linguistic types derives from discrimination and intolerance of groups who speak those languages.</p>
        <p>By acknowledging the role language plays in reinforcing these inequalities, we recognize the privileges and disadvantages of different groups of people. This section aims to inform and remind you of the different ways in which you, as both academic scholar and citizen of the world, should be aware of the language you use. By clarifying terms and providing more inclusive, equality-based alternatives, we hope that you will write with increasing attention to and awareness of the diversity of experiences that your audience will have. (Because terms and preferences vary and change, we have compiled only general guidelines. Our suggestions should be considered in the contexts of their usages.)</p>

        <title>Writing with Awareness</title>
        <p><term>Ethnocentrism</term> and <term>Global Awareness.</term> When people consider their culture superior to other cultures, or when they view and evaluate other cultures through the lens of their own culture, we say that they are being ethnocentric. Ethnocentrism can be difficult to avoid because it is not always easy to recognize how your cultural lens affects your world-view. While you may perceive your way of living as the best and most valid, global awareness encourages us to remember that there are other, equally valid lifestyles and experiences. In order to write with global awareness, then, you should avoid writing ethnocentrically. Here are some questions to ask yourself as you write:<ul>
        <li>Am I making broad generalizations, or do I write with complexity and nuance about people who are different than me?</li>
        <li>Am I making value judgments about other ways of living? If so, are they appropriate to the specific discipline or course for which I'm writing?</li>
        <li>Do I use thorough and fair scholarly sources?</li>
        <li>Are all of my claims supported with evidence?</li>
        <li>Do my warrants (the logic connecting my evidence to my claims) rely on Western/American definitions or world-views (e.g. evidence: a certain group of people still uses hunting and gathering as its primary mode of subsistence, claim: people in this group are uncivilized, warrant: <q>civilization</q> is defined by advanced agriculture)?</li></ul></p>

        <title>Writing with Respect</title>
        <p>Writing with respect is a crucial component of writing with awareness. By demonstrating to your readers that you are aware and respectful of the various identities and experiences with which they identify, you make your writing more inclusive and inviting. In so doing, you open up your topic and argument to a more friendly and diverse dialogue. Here are some tips for avoiding disrespectful language in your writing:<ul>
            <li>Don't make generalizations about groups of people. No individual represents an entire group, and individuals cannot be wholly defined by the group they are in.</li>
            <li>Don't (intentionally or otherwise) write harmful, bigoted, or ignorant statements about people or groups of people. If you're unsure of whether or not what you're writing is harmful, do some Google searches or ask people who have a greater knowledge of the group in question.</li>
            <li>Don't talk about marginalized individuals or groups only in terms of their marginalization. Needless to say, a woman of color, for example, may be just as much a scientist as a white man may be. Unless you're writing specifically about how those differences have impacted her professional life, there is no need to mention them.</li>
            <li>Use inclusive language as much as possible. Inclusive language (described at length in the following section) dramatically enhances the respect a writer conveys in their writing (as well as their own authority as a scholar).</li>
        </ul></p>

                <conclusion>
                    <p>The use of masculine <q>He</q> as the standard pronoun implies all four of these terms. A respectful writer can avoid this implication by using plural pronouns to address <q>readers,</q> or by using the third-person plural <q>they</q> as a neutral singular pronoun.</p>

                        <title>Mix up the order</title>
                        <p>If you refer frequently to men and women, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, etc., mix up the order to avoid putting one gender continually ahead of the other. (Note: to avoid perpetuating these gender binaries, you can use alternatives such as <q>distinguished guests</q>, <q>people</q>, <q>human beings</q>, <q>children</q>, <q>adults</q>, <q>individuals</q>, and <q>couples</q>).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Refer to women in the same way you would men</title>
                        <p>If you wouldn't say <q>Mr. Faulkner</q> when writing about Faulkner, then don't say <q>Ms. Austen</q> when writing about Jane Austen. Similarly, if a woman holds a title like <q>Dr.,</q> then refer to her as Dr. <fillin characters="5"/> in the same way you would refer to a male MD or PhD.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Avoid sexist descriptions and terminology</title>
                        <p>Numerous English words are rooted in sexist ideas about how women should act and live. Terms like barren, spinster, feisty, coy, shrill, emotional, hysteric, frumpy, exotic, ditzy, and catty all make implicit judgments about women.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Be conscious of gender stereotypes</title>
                        <p>Pay attention to where you're using certain pronouns. Saying, <q>The lawyer won his trial</q> and <q>The nurse couldn't find her scrubs</q> are also forms of sexist language because they perpetuate gender stereotypes (i.e., the assumption that lawyers are always men and nurses are always women).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <title>Be conscious of heteronormativity</title>
                        <p>Women don't always marry men. Women don't always marry. To this effect, phrases such as <q>She needs a man</q> or <q>She should get married</q> perpetuate heteronormative expectations.</p>

                        <p>Just as with women and people from minoritized backgrounds, only refer to disabilities if they are relevant to what you're writing. For example, referencing a wheelchair in a sentence like <q>A man in a wheelchair let me borrow his pen</q> is unnecessary and ableist.

            <title>Non-racist language</title>
            <p>There is no consensus regarding the correct terms to describe races. When referring to a particular person or group, use the term that they prefer. If they do not indicate a preference, opt for a generally accepted term. For instance, in contemporary America, using the word <q>black</q> as an adjective (as with <q>black people</q>) is widely accepted as inoffensive. Whereas before the term <q>colored</q> was widely used, it is now generally considered inappropriate. Do some research and do not be afraid to engage in conversations about appropriate usage. Despite the nuance required here, there remain some obviously racist terms which do not warrant use in formal writing.</p>
            <p>(In regard to the proper capitalization of a word such as <q>black,</q> especially in relation to <q>white,</q> there remains no consensus. You can ask your professors for their preferences and, as always, research the implications of each usage. It is always best to be intentional, consistent, and open-minded.)</p>
            <p>The distinction between Native American and American Indian is equally vague and widely contested. American Indian includes indigenous peoples from the continental U.S., while Native American encompasses indigenous peoples from Alaska and Hawaii. As always, if a preference is expressed, respect it. If not, do some research and select a term advisedly.</p>
            <p>Latino/a (in other stylizations, Latin@, Latinx, which have slightly different meanings) refers to <q>any person of Latin American descent living in America.</q> Hispanic describes any person of Spanish-speaking heritage. The meanings of these terms are debated and, as a result, not fixed.</p>
            <p>A special note on the term <q>minority,</q> courtesy of the Nesbitt-Johnson Writing Center at Hamilton College: <q>Avoid the term minority if possible. Minority is often used to describe groups of people who are not part of the majority. This term is being phased out because it may imply inferiority and because minorities often are not in the numerical minority. An alternative might be historically marginalized populations. If avoiding the term is not possible, qualify the term with the appropriate specific descriptor: religious minority NOT minority.</q></p>

                <p>Recall that a pronoun is a word that refers to a noun, including words like I, you, me, he, she, and they.</p>
                <p>People's preferred pronouns reflect their <term>gender identity.</term> Gender identity is the internal, personal perception that one has about one's own gender. A person can identify on either end of the gender binary (man/woman or boy/girl), or in between or outside of it.</p>
                <p>In English, people who identify as female typically use she/her pronouns, and those who identify as male usually use he/him pronouns. Individuals whose gender identity does not fit the binary sometimes use they/them pronouns.</p>
                <p>Pronouns are important extensions of people's gender identity. If you don't know what pronouns someone prefers, simply ask them, <q>What are your preferred pronouns?</q> If you accidentally use the wrong pronoun, apologize, correct yourself, and remember for next time.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <p>The use of the third-person plural <q>they</q> as a gender-neutral alternative to English's gendered third-person singular pronouns (<q>he</q> and <q>she</q>) is becoming widely accepted. For more information, see <xref ref="subject-verb-agreement" text="type-global"/>.</p>

            <p>Avoid classist terms such as: ghetto, white-trash, classy, thug, inner-city.</p>
            <p>Avoid terms like <q>high class</q> and <q>low class</q> because they make implicit judgments about people within certain socioeconomic settings.</p>

            <title>Global awareness</title>
            <p><q>Global South</q> is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to neo-colonial phrases such as <q>developing countries</q> and <q>third world.</q></p>
            <p>We live in the shadow of a period of colonialism and Western ethnocentrism. It is important, when writing, to be aware of these histories and of their ideological, social, political, cultural, and economical results.</p>

            <p><xref ref="AAVE">African-American Vernacular English</xref> (<xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref>), also called African-American English (<init>AAE</init>), Black English (<init>BE</init>), and Black English Vernacular (<init>BEV</init>) is a variety of English characterized by a few distinct grammatical and phonological rules.</p>

            <title>Standard American English</title>
            <p>While many speakers of <xref ref="SAE">Standard American English</xref> (<xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref>), especially those in power, see <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> as simply <sq>incorrect,</sq> slang, or <sq>broken</sq> English, <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> is as rule-bound and correct in its own context as any other language or language variety. Being rule-bound means that there are consistent rules in <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> that dictate what a speaker can and cannot do. Below are several examples of these rules.</p>

                <li>
                    <title>Third person singular</title>
                    <p>The third person singular consists of <sq>he</sq> and <sq>she</sq> (and <sq>they,</sq> when it's used as a gender-neutral, third-person singular). <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref> conjugates the third person singular with an -s, so <q>to say</q> becomes conjugated as <q>she says.</q> In <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref>, the rule for conjugating third person singular does not include adding an -s, so <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> speakers would say <q>she say.</q></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Multiple negation</title>
                    <p>In <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref>, a speaker cannot correctly say, <q>She didn't go nowhere,</q> because <sq>did not</sq> and <sq>nowhere</sq> are both negative. Instead, <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref> speakers will replace <q>nowhere</q> with <q>anywhere.</q> In <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref>, the correct way to convey a negative is by retaining the negative form <q>nowhere</q> after the negated verb. Thus, <q>She didn't go nowhere</q> is correct syntax in <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref>. (For any Francophiles or Edith Piaf fans, French also uses this type of multiple negation: <q><foreign>Non, je ne regrette rien.</foreign></q>)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Zero copula (deletion of the <q>to be</q> verb)</title>
                    <p>Zero copula occurs in numerous languages, including Russian. In English, copula deletion looks like this: <q>He nice.</q> Copula deletion is not allowed in <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref>, so this sentence would be <q>He is nice,</q> or, alternatively, <q>He's nice,</q> with a contraction of <q>he</q> and <q>is.</q> <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> uses copula deletion quite frequently, so <q>He nice</q> is a perfectly grammatically correct sentence. In fact, zero copula often occurs in <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> in places where <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref> speakers would use a contraction (eg., <q>He's going</q> and <q>He going,</q> <q>They're great</q> and <q>They great</q>).</p>

                    <title>Habitual <q>be</q></title>
                    <p>To indicate that something occurs habitually, <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref> speakers would use sentences like <q>He is always talking,</q> or <q>They are usually quiet,</q> but in <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref>, these forms are replaced by the habitual <q>be.</q> The previous two sentences in <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> would be constructed like this: <q>He be talking,</q> and <q>They be quiet.</q> Some linguists think that this structure derived from Irish and creole influences in the American South.</p>

                    <title>Pronunciation of voiceless <q>th</q> as <q>t</q> or <q>f</q></title>
                    <p>In <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref>, the voiceless <q>th</q> (as found in words like thin, thick, bath, and tooth) is often pronounced as <q>t</q> at the beginning of words (such as tin, tick) or as <q>f</q> at the end of words (such as baf, toof). This shift is a specific phonological feature of <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> and follows rules that dictate when a speaker uses these particular sounds. An <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> speaker would not, for example, be able to use the <q>t</q> of <q>f</q> sounds to replace the <q>th</q> sound that <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref> speakers use in <q>the.</q> (See the next point.)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Pronunciation of voiced <q>th</q> as <q>d</q> or <q>v</q></title>
                    <p>In <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref>, the voiced <q>th</q> (as found in words like then, that, weather, either, and father) is often pronounced as <q>d</q> (such as den, dat) or as <q>v</q> (such as eiver, faver). Similarly to the last point, these shifts are rule-bound. <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> speakers would not say <q>fen or fat</q> instead of <q>then or that,</q> nor would they say <q>bav or toov</q> instead of <q>bath or tooth.</q> Because these pronunciations are rule-bound, there are specific ways in which speakers can and cannot use each pronunciation.</p>
                    <p>(If you're familiar with linguistics or IPA, you might also notice that <q>t</q> and <q>d</q> have the same place and manner of articulation, but <q>t</q> is voiceless and <q>d</q> is voiced. <q>F</q> and <q>v</q> also have the same place and manner of articulation, but <q>f</q> is voiceless and <q>v</q> is voiced.)</p>

                    <title><q>Y'all</q> for third person plural possessive and <q>they</q> for third plural possessive</title>
                    <p><xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref> speakers use <q>your</q> and <q>their</q> for these possessive forms. For situations in which <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref> speakers would make statements like <q>That's your dog [referring to multiple people],</q> or <q>Here's their car,</q> <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> speakers would say, <q>That's y'all dog,</q> and <q>Here's they car.</q></p>

                <li>
                    <title>Post-vocalic R deletion</title>
                    <p><xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> speakers delete the <q>r</q> sound following vowels and preceding consonants, most frequently when the R is at the end of a word. Examples of post-vocalic R deletion include <q>fo' dogs</q> or <q>mo' trees,</q> instead of <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref>'s pronunciation, <q>four dogs</q> or <q>more trees.</q></p>

                <li>
                    <title>Unstressed and stressed been/bin</title>
                    <p>In <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref>, speakers use unstressed been or bin in the same way that <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref> speakers use <q>has/have been.</q> In <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref>, someone would say, <q>He been [unstressed] working,</q> which in <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref> would be, <q>He has been working.</q> Stressed been or bin, on the other hand, is used in <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> to indicate that something happened in the distant past. An example would be, <q>She been [stressed] an artist,</q> which in <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref> would be, <q>She's been an artist for a long time.</q></p>

                    <title>Preterite had</title>
                    <p>In contexts in which <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref> speakers would use the simple past (usually in narratives), <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> speakers use <q>had</q>. For example, while an <xref ref="SAE"><init>SAE</init></xref> speaker might say, <q>We planted a tree,</q> an <xref ref="AAVE"><init>AAVE</init></xref> speaker might say, <q>We had planted a tree.</q></p>
