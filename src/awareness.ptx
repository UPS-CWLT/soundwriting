    <introduction>
        <blockquote>
            <p>We at Puget Sound intentionally conceptualize and view diversity as a matter of equity and inclusion. In doing so, we aim to understand and actively respond to the ways organizational aspects of our society and of our own university often work against those principles, excluding some groups and individuals from our community while including others. The work of diversity, accordingly, seeks to account for and redress deeply embedded historical practices and legacies, forms of cultural and social representation, and institutional policies and processes that can systematically exclude groups or individuals from full participation in higher education and the considerable benefits it offers.</p>

        <p>Language use is part of this work of diversity; as writers, we are also part of that work. While the impacts of language on individual feelings and circumstances may, on the surface, seem insignificant (<q>sticks and stones,</q> as the adage goes), language can embody prejudice, discrimination, and status hierarchies. Words, like people and societies, have histories. Some words, such as racial slurs, are overtly bigoted, while others more subtly express longstanding stereotypes or attitudes about particular groups of people. For instance, patronizing and parochial treatment of specific languages or linguistic types derives from discrimination and intolerance of groups who speak those languages.</p>
        <p>By acknowledging the role language plays in reinforcing inequalities, we recognize the privileges and disadvantages of different groups of people. Additionally, using words rooted in hate and oppression perpetuates hate and oppression and denies groups of people opportunities to reclaim their individual and collective agency. However, if we are unfamiliar with such histories, it can sometimes be difficult to identify terminologies of oppression.</p>
        <p>This chapter aims to offer different ways for us, as scholars and citizens of the world, to be intentional about and ethical in the language we use. We have attempted to clarify terms and provide more inclusive, equality-based alternatives, and we hope that these will help us all as writers to be aware of and attentive to the diversity of experiences that our audiences will have.</p>
        <p>Because terms and preferences vary and change, we have compiled only general guidelines, and our suggestions should be considered in the contexts of their usages. Please also note that each section deals with a complex subject, and there are excellent resources here on campus for learning more. We make suggestions in each section below about departments and programs that offer relevant courses, but our suggestions are not comprehensive. Looking for courses that fulfill the <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/curriculum-courses/knowledge-identity-and-power">Knowledge, Identity, and Power</url> (<acro>KNOW</acro>) graduation requirement is another good way to find relevant courses. Get involved in the <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/race-pedagogy-institute">Race and Pedagogy Institute</url> (<init>RPI</init>) or in programs offered through the <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/student-life/cice/">Center for Intercultural and Civic Engagement</url> (<init>CICE</init>).</p>
        <p>We've tried to be as nuanced as possible in a short space, but, there are surely things we have missed and things we still need to learn. However, just as language can change, so, too, can this handbook. If you would like to suggest any improvements to the guidelines that follow, please email us at <url href="mailto:soundwriting@pugetsound.edu"><c>soundwriting@pugetsound.edu</c></url>.</p>

        <title>Writing with Respect</title>
        <p>Writing with respect is a crucial component of writing with awareness. By demonstrating to your readers that you strive to be aware and respectful of their various identities and experiences, you make your writing more inclusive and inviting<mdash/>and make it more likely that your audience will engage with your ideas.</p>
        <p>To write respectfully about other people, it is helpful to be aware of our own identities and positionalities. We are all informed by our experiences, and it is not always easy to recognize how our cultural lenses affects our world-views. We are all, to some degree, ethnocentric; we know our own culture (and gender, ability, race, sexuality, class, religion, <etc/>) best, and we cannot help but view and evaluate other cultures through our own experiences; we may even implicitly consider our own identity to be superior to that of others, and it may take explicit attention to remember that there are other equally valid lifestyles and experiences. In order to write with awareness, then, we should avoid writing ethnocentrically.</p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Am I making broad generalizations, or do I write with complexity and nuance about people who are different than me? Am I considering other perspectives respectfully rather than in a patronizing or paternalistic way?</li>
                    <li>Am I making value judgments about other ways of living? If so, are they appropriate to the specific discipline or course for which I'm writing?</li>
                    <li>Do I use thorough and fair scholarly sources?</li>
                    <li>Are all of my claims supported with evidence?</li>
                    <li>Do my warrants (the logic connecting my evidence to my claims, see <xref ref="different-argumentation-models"/>) rely on Western/American definitions or world-views (for example, evidence: a certain group of people still uses hunting and gathering as its primary mode of subsistence; claim: people in this group are uncivilized; warrant: <q>civilization</q> is defined by advanced agriculture)?</li>
                    <li>Am I aware of my own cultural biases and mindful about how they might affect my scholarship and language choices?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </convention>
        <paragraphs xml:id="par-write-respect-historical-baggage">
            <title>Historical Baggage</title>
            <p>Words carry baggage made up of the social structures, hierarchies, and power dynamics that they are associated with. These social contexts have long-lasting legacies and so even though a social structure may no longer exist, the words associated with it carry forth the historical memory of that structure and their use can reinforce or assert it. For example, the use of the n-word by White people hearkens back to a time in America when White people enslaved, tortured, raped, and murdered Black people in a systematically supported way. Some Black people today have reclaimed the n-word, and many other marginalized groups have reclaimed other slurs used against them. In these cases, the use of a slur by a member of the group targeted by the slur can be empowering because it is a symbol for surviving an oppressive, violent system and serves as a source or empowerment for continuing to fight oppressors and oppressive systems. On the other hand, its use by a White person is unacceptable because it is a reenactment of those oppressive power systems, which have a legacy that continues to impact peopleâ€™s lived experiences in the United States.</p>
            <p>To complicate things, some once-derogatory words can become neutral, and some once-neutral terms can become derogatory, and this too is important to keep in mind as you write and speak about people and their identities. For example, the term <q>Quaker</q> was originally a derogatory label for members of the Religious Society of Friends, however, it has since lost its offensive meaning and is an accepted name. Contrastingly, the word <q>moron</q> started out as a clinical term for people with mental disabilities but has since become derogatory. Furthermore, some words carry specific derogatory histories when used together, for example calling Black women <q>angry</q> or women in general <q>hysterical</q> connote racist and sexist stereotypes, respectively.</p>
            <p>Because the historical contexts that words reference have ongoing legacies that impact people differently, a word that seems harmless to one person might cause harm to another person. As you write, take care to learn about the historical baggage that the words you use carry, and be receptive to feedback your readers share with you about the impact your word choice has on them.</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Othering</title>
            <p>Some words and concepts create and perpetuate a narrative about who and what is normal, and who deviates from this norm, usually based on aspects of identity, such as race, religion or gender. Often this process of <q>Othering</q> dehumanizes those marked as different, and engenders and justifies supremacist ideologies such as racism and ethnocentrism. <q>Othering</q> has been used to justify many horrific acts of violence, such as settler-colonialism in the Americas, the transatlantic slave trade, and the Holocaust and other genocides.</p>
            <p><q>Othering</q> continues to justify violence. For example, calling women of color <q>exotic</q> is often dehumanizing and <q>othering,</q> reinforcing a cultural narrative in the United States that hypersexualizes women of color and underlies the high rates of sexual violence against (particularly transgender) women of color. Sometimes <q>othering</q> paints the <q>other</q> in a positive light, but this is still dehumanizing. For example, the <q>noble savage</q> trope has encouraged the appropriation of Native American traditions by non-indigenous people in the United States. As you write, take care not to <q>other</q> groups you are writing about through your words or narratives.</p>

            <title>Strategies for Writing with Respect</title>
            <ul>
                <li><title>Write with specificity</title>
                    <p>Don't make generalizations about groups of people. No individual represents an entire group, and individuals cannot be wholly defined by the groups they are in.</p>
                </li>
                <li><title>Write with attention and the desire to keep learning</title>
                    <p>Don't intentionally write harmful, bigoted, or ignorant statements about people or groups of people. If you're unsure of whether or not what you're writing is harmful, do some research or ask people who have a greater knowledge of the group in question, preferably someone within that group.</p>
                </li>
                <li><title>Write with equity</title>
                    <p>Don't make marginalization central to your description of marginalized individuals or groups, unless marginalization is the topic at hand. For instance, a woman of color can be a scientist<mdash/>just as someone with a less culturally marked identity can be. When you write about a woman of color who is a scientist, unless the focus of your writing is how her identity has impacted her professional life, concentrate on the science she does, and simply describe her as a scientist.</p>
                </li>
                <li><title>Use your best judgment about using people-first language</title>
                    <p>People-first language can be an important way to emphasize a person rather than one aspect of their identity. For example, saying <q>She is an asthmatic</q> can emphasize her disability while <q>She is a person who has asthma,</q> emphasizes that she is a person firstâ€”a person who may also be a parent, a teacher, and a person with any number of other significant identities. At the same time, there is no universal preference for people-first language; there are many situations where person-first language might actually be more awkward or inappropriate. For example, many members of the Autistic community are resisting being called <q>a person with Aspergers</q> as opposed to Autistic or Aspie, saying this IS a central part of their personhood and that the other theoretically more inclusive language is dismissive of their experience. This is similar to how we would not call a black person <q>A person with blackness.</q> When writing, do some research and use your best judgment to determine if you should use people-first language, and whenever possible use the language preferred by the people or community you are writing about.</p>
                </li>
                <li><title>Commit to spending time educating yourself</title>
                    <p>Keep in mind that you bear the responsibility of your learning; do not expect others to teach you if you have not put in the work to teach yourself. As you seek to learn from others, be aware of the workload you may be placing on them. Often people facing the most marginalization are most burdened with educating others about their identities and experiences, so work to educate yourself first before potentially adding to this burden.</p>

            <p>At the root of writing with awareness about identity is an understanding of <term>intersectionality<idx>intersectionality</idx></term>. Despite its frequent use, there remains a great deal of misunderstanding about what the term actually means (even among scholars!). Consequently, the aim of this guide is to help you begin thinking about intersectionality, and ultimately write more inclusively about identity.</p>
            <p>Intersectionality is a framework for understanding how marginalized individuals and groups of people face complex and interlocking forms of oppression due to the overlapping nature of their identities.</p>

            </observation>
            <p><q>Intersectionality</q> is a relatively new word to describe a very old concept. The term was coined in 1989 by Black feminist lawyer KimberlÃ© Crenshaw to describe how the discrimination faced by Black women is simultaneously based on race and gender. In a seminar at the 2001 World Conference Against Racism, Crenshaw used the metaphor of a traffic intersection to describe how women of color must simultaneously navigate multiple forms of oppression saying <q>intersectionality is what occurs when a woman from a minority group <ellipsis /> tries to navigate the main crossing in the city.<ellipsis /> The main highway is Racism Road. One cross street can be Colonialism, [the other] Patriarchy Street.</q> Rather than navigate each road in isolation of the others, the woman of color must navigate them all at the same time, their interaction making her task that much more complex. Accordingly, because everyone has intersectional identities oppressive systems are not navigated separately but rather concurrently. Thus, when intersectionality is overlaid with power imbalances, those with multiple marginalized identities<mdash />such as being Black and female in the U.S., or disabled, Queer and poor<mdash />experience oppression and discrimination against several aspects of their identity.</p>

            <p>While the term intersectionality was initially coined to describe the struggles of Black women in the feminist movement, it can be used even more broadly to understand how systems of oppression are interconnected, and how individuals and groups face discrimination based on multiple identities. As you write, consider the ways that intersectionality applies to your topic. For example, if you are writing about salaries in the United States, explore how they intersect with gender (<eg /> men make more money than women, gender non-conforming, and trans people), race (<eg /> white women make more money than women of color), and ability (people with mental and physical illnesses have a harder time acquiring and keeping jobs than their able-bodied counterparts). At the same time, be careful about highlighting an aspect of someoneâ€™s identity if it may not actually be relevant (see the guideline in <xref ref="writewithequity" /> which contains other important notes about people-first language and writing with specificity). As you write, we encourage you to use the following subsections in conjunction with one another.</p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection xml:id="gender-inclusivity">
            <title>Language Toward Gender Inclusivity</title>
            <p>Sexism refers to discrimination against individuals based on sex and has historically described discrimination specifically against women. The perceived social and biological inferiority of women has existed for centuries in the West (and also throughout the globe), and although women in the last century have made advances<mdash/>the right to own property and vote, for example<mdash/>sexism prevails, especially against women of color and trans women. Women still, on average, earn lower wages than men; women are much more likely than men to be raped or stalked; and women are still underrepresented in positions of power and leadership. Importantly, women of color, at the intersection of race and gender, face each of these challenges to a greater extent than White women. Examples of such intersectional injustices are how, on average, White and Asian American women make about 20% less than White men, while Black and Latina women make about 30 and 40% less than White men respectively or how female immigrants of color sometimes have to choose between reporting domestic abuse and facing deportation or detention. (To learn more about intersectionality, visit <xref ref="intersectionality"/>) Part of writing with awareness and respect means that you as an author are attentive to the context of historical and current discrimination that women face and cognizant of how the choices you make in writing engage with that context.</p>
            <p>Writing with attention to gender inclusivity, however, can be onerous because sexism is ingrained in English. As we wrote at the beginning of this chapter, language can embody prejudice, discrimination, and hierarchies. We have historically used the pronoun <q>he</q> as the standard, universal pronoun. In English, we have only <q>Mr.</q> for men (a title that is the same, regardless of men's marital status), but <q>Miss</q> and <q>Mrs.</q> for women (titles that mark not only gender but also marital status as an essential component of a woman's identity). We also have policemen, firemen, fishermen,and many other job titles that are used generically for all employees in the profession, even though women also work in those professions; many of those titles have female equivalents (policewoman, firewoman, fisherwoman), but those titles are never used generically to refer to all people in the profession<mdash/>and gender is not necessarily important to the work involved in those job titles.</p>
            <p>But language changes! <q>He</q> is no longer generally accepted as a universal pronoun, and alternatives like singular <q>they</q> have grown in popularity and acceptance (to read more about they as a singular pronoun, check out <xref ref="singular-they" text="title"/>). <q>Ms.</q> was created as a parallel title to <q>Mr.,</q> as titles that do not mark marital status. Professional titles such as <q>flight attendant,</q> instead of <q>stewardess,</q> offer gender-neutral job titles that emphasize the work the person does, rather than the gender of the person doing the work. These changes come not from grammarians; they come from people like you who saw injustice and acted against it. Keep reading to learn more about what you can do to continue to combat sexism in your speaking and writing.</p>

                <title>Strategies for Writing with Gender Inclusivity in Mind</title>
                <ul>
                    <li><title>Mix up the order</title>
                        <p>If you refer frequently to men and women, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, <etc/>, mix up the order to avoid putting one gender continually ahead of the other. In fact, unless gender is a central facet of your discussion, it's better to avoid perpetuating gender binaries by using alternatives such as <q>distinguished guests,</q> <q>people,</q> <q>human beings,</q> <q>children,</q> <q>adults,</q> <q>individuals,</q> and <q>couples.</q></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><title>Refer to women in the same way you would men</title>
                        <p>If you wouldn't say <q>Mr. Faulkner</q> when writing about Faulkner, then don't say <q>Ms. Austen</q> when writing about Jane Austen. Similarly, if a woman holds a title like <q>Dr.,</q> then refer to her as Dr. in the same way you would refer to a male M.D. or Ph.D.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><title>Avoid sexist descriptions and terminology</title>
                        <p>Numerous English words are rooted in sexist ideas about how women should act and live. Terms like <q>barren,</q> <q>spinster,</q> <q>feisty,</q> <q>coy,</q> <q>shrill,</q> <q>emotional,</q> <q>hysterical,</q> <q>frumpy,</q> <q>exotic,</q> <q>ditzy,</q> and <q>catty</q> can all convey implicit judgments about women. Note: the word <q>exotic</q> in particular is an intersectionally oppressive word that has been historically applied to women of color. The word acts to reify Whiteness as the norm while in turn hypersexualizing women of color, and thus making them the targets of sexual violence.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><title>Be conscious of gender stereotypes</title>
                        <p>Pay attention to where you're using certain pronouns.

            <title>Language Toward Neurological and Physical Inclusivity</title>
            <p>What is considered an illness or disability has changed throughout history and also varies between cultural contexts. Disability has also been stigmatized and wielded as a form of social control; a member of the University of Puget Sound National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) gave the examples of both <em>drapetomania</em>, an illness that white psychologists hypothesized as the cause for Black slaves to want to run away from enslavement in the 19th century, and hysteria, which was used as a form of social control for women. Today, both of these illnesses are considered pseudoscience and understood to be part of a long history of scientific racism, and sexism respectively.</p>
            <p>Despite the progress that has been made, disabilities and illnesses continue to be stigmatized, and the way we write about them has the power to break down or perpetuate stereotypes that directly affect the lives of people with these conditions. Additionally, many terms carry <xref ref="par-write-respect-historical-baggage"/> that we, as writers, arenâ€™t always aware of; for instance, while in the early twentieth century people classified as <q>idiots</q> were subject to forced sterilization, we now use the word casually. By learning the history behind the words we use and choosing to write respectfully about people with mental and physical disabilities we help create a culture that rejects ableism.</p>

            <p>Mental health and mental illness are frequently mistaken as synonyms; however, mental health refers to a personâ€™s mental well-being<mdash />including their emotions, thoughts, feelings, and the ability to overcome challenging situations<mdash />while mental illnesses are disorders affecting the way one thinks, feels, behaves, or interacts with the world. Just as it is possible to have poor physical health (<eg /> a broken arm) without having a physical illness, so too do many people experience poor mental health without having a mental illness. People may fall anywhere on the mental health and mental illness spectrums: for example, someone with a chronic mental illness such as OCD may have good mental health. Sometimes mental health concerns that go untreated can develop into mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Additionally, where each of us falls on the health and illness spectrums is always changing, and we will all experience poor health at some point in our life.</p> 
            <p>In fact, one way of thinking about disability is that any time we spend able-bodied is really time spent <q>temporarily able-bodied</q> since we will all experience disability in our lifetimes. Despite the widespread incidence of disability, disabilities are stigmatized in many cultures, and people with disabilities are discriminated against in both overt ways (such as the eugenics movement) and covert ways (such as buildings that lack wheelchair access and/or Braille translations). A member of the University of Puget Sound NAMI club described how mental illnesses are also sometimes regarded as less legitimate than physical illnesses because they are less visible, giving the example that people are more likely to consider it a sign of weakness to take medication for a mental illness than for a physical illness; just as you would not tell someone with diabetes that they should learn to stop depending on their insulin medication, so, too, would you not consider that someone with a mental illness should eventually grow out of taking their medication.</p>

                <blockquote><p>Constantly considering the ways in which mental health and mental illness intersect with a lot of other identities is really important. They donâ€™t exist in isolation from other people's identities, They really intersect with your sexual orientation, your gender identity, your race, your socioeconomic background<ellipsis />you can't really write about mental health and mental illness in isolation of all of those factors that are brought into it.</p>

            <p>As you write about mental and physical illnesses, be conscious of how they intersect with other aspects of identity. For example, as a member of the University of Puget Sound NAMI club points out, a woman with a mental illness is more likely to be written about as weak and emotional, while men with mental illness tend to be portrayed as violent and angry. These depictions perpetuate false stereotypes of both mental illness and gender. Additionally, the way physical and mental illnesses are conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated varies between different cultures, and factors such as immigration, racial discrimination, and expensive healthcare and medication make access to treatment inaccessible for many people. When writing about illnesses, health, and disability, avoid making broad generalizations, since peopleâ€™s bodily experiences are dependent on a plethora of other aspects of their identities. Additionally, because of this diversity, the experience of a mental illness for one person is often not the same as for another, and a treatment that works for one person will not necessarily work for another. For more on the importance of writing with specificity, see <xref ref="intersectionality"/> on intersectionality.</p>
            <p>While it is impossible to foresee and prevent every knowledge gap, using people-first language can be a way to combat ableism by acknowledging the common humanity of all individuals rather than referring to certain individuals only by their disability or handicap. To learn more about whether to use people-first language, review <xref ref="writewithequity"/>. The use of ableist words and phrases remains common in both written and spoken communication. Check out the example below for a list of words to avoid as well as words that you can choose to use instead to write and think more equitably.

            <title>Language Toward Racial and Ethnic Inclusivity</title>
            <p>Writing about race and ethnicity is complex because both are linked to past and present histories of horrific oppression and intergroup conflict with correspondingly deep individual and group trauma. Both ethnicity and race can make people targets of stereotyping, prejudice, and violence, and at the same time provide a sense of belonging or pride for people. Like most other identities, the categories of race and ethnicity have differed between places and across time. For example, in the United States, court cases such as <pubtitle>Dow v. United States (1915)</pubtitle><mdash/>which determined that Syrian people were not <q>white</q><mdash/>have been part of sculpting the racial categories we are familiar with today. Racial and ethnic categories continue to drastically impact all of our lives, and so, while complicated, it is important to be aware of the histories behind the words we use and the ways we write about race and ethnicity in order to not perpetuate racist ideologies. See <xref ref="list-racial-inclusivity-terms"/> for relevant definitions as you read this section.</p>

            <p>Racial prejudice and racism, though related, are distinctly different. Racial prejudice is discrimination against someone because of their race. Racism is a sociocultural phenomenon that takes into account histories of racial inequality and describes a system that benefits people in a dominant racial group (whether or not they want to benefit) through the oppression of other racial groups. Because racism is a result of dependent on past and present systemic racial inequality, <q>reverse racism</q> does not exist. For example, in the United States there has never been a set of laws and political and economic institutions that enforce the dominance of people of color over White people as there have been in support of White supremacy. Therefore, while a person of color may hold racial prejudice towards a White person, there is no structural support for their prejudice that enables them to exert <q>reverse racism.</q></p>
            <p>Racism has manifested in many different ways. Some forms are overt, such as <q>Whites Only</q> signs during the Jim Crow era; other racist histories are embedded in language in less obvious ways. For example, the term <q>Caucasian</q> as a synonym for White has its origins in pseudoâ€“scientific theories about the racial divisions. Although white-skinned people might feel uncomfortable with a racial descriptor such as White, using that term is one way to use equivalent terms; there is ethnocentric bias in assuming whiteness as a standard and using terms like Black, Asian, and Latino to designate people as different from that standard. Racism can also appear under the guise of being approving. For example, calling women of color <q>exotic</q> is both dehumanizing and othering, which has been used to justify acts of sexual violence against women of color in the U.S. (among other places).</p>

            <p>It is helpful to be aware of conventions within particular disciplines. Remember that these conventions may reflect racism that exists in the academy, and that scholars within and across different academic disciplines may not agree on definitions and conventions related to race and ethnicity. When in doubt, do some research and do not be afraid to engage in conversations about appropriate usage. When referring to a particular person or group, use the term that they prefer (though when directly asking people, be mindful of the burden you may be placing on them to educate you). You may not get unanimous feedback on what the best terminology is; lots of terminology is in flux, and what is respectful or correct is contested. For example, there remains no consensus about the proper capitalization of <q>Black,</q> especially in relation to <q>White.</q> Additionally, the distinction between <q>Native American</q> and <q>American Indian</q> is also contested. You can ask your professors for their preferences and, as always, research the implications of each usage; it is always best to be intentional and open-minded.</p>

            <p>Racism is embedded in histories of the academy. Our understanding of many fields of knowledge is limited by the perspectives of the people who were publishing in those fields. It is only recently that the academy has begun to be shaped by the voices of people who look like our world more broadly. Even as you read published, peer-reviewed, scholarly sources, read with a critical eye, considering how the author's identity and experiences might shape the lens they use to look at the world. Understanding what perspective the author may have been coming from can give you a lot of context about why they have the ideas they do, which methodologies they use, and how they define their terms. Additionally, it gives you an opportunity to think about what voices you are bringing into your paper: Are you representing a diversity of perspectives? Are you including the voices of people from the communities about which youâ€™re writing?</p>

                        <p>Latino/a (in other stylings, Latin@, Latinx, which have slightly different meanings) refers to any person of Latin American descent living in America. Mexican Americans may also identify as Chicano/a/x (or Xicano/a/x). The terms Chicano/a come from the 1960's Mexican American Civil Rights Movement and represent a more political stance on identity than Latino/a (as they are examples of words that were reappropriated by the people who they originally referred to in a derogatory way). Hispanic describes any person of Spanish-speaking heritage. While some Latinos find the term <q>Hispanic</q> offensive because it reinforces the history of Spanish colonialism, others (particularly Latinos in the American Southwest) embrace and use the identifier. Furthermore, <q>Latino/a/x</q> also references/privileges European descent in its etymology, and <q>Chicano/a/x</q>, which nods to a Mesoamerican indigenous nation, is seen by some to obscure the complicated nature of modern Mexican and Mexican American identity (which has come to include Afro-Mexicans, Mexicans of Chinese descent, and, increasingly, Central Americans).

            <title>Language Toward <init>LGBTQ+</init> Inclusivity</title>
            <p><init>LGBTQ+</init> spans a wide and complicated range of sexual orientations, gender identities, and diverse bodies. The acronym itself stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer/Questioning and others. Even this list does not cover the full range of identities represented by the acronym<mdash/> indeed, some advocate for an extended <init>LGBTQQIAP2S</init>, which stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Pansexual, and Two-Spirit. Other terms for the community of people who do not identify within the dominant forms of sexuality and gender (heterosexuality or cisgenderism) include <init>GSM</init> (Gender and Sexuality Minorities) or <init>GSD</init> (Gender and Sexuality Diverse). These last two terms, in particular, indicate that members of this community do not all identify as one particular identity at all times; many individuals within the community choose not to identify or to identify as fluid. The amorphous nature of the name portends the difficulty writers may have when referring to individuals within the community: the language of the <init>LGBTQ+</init> community is ever-evolving, so it may not always be clear to you which term to use. To be as respectful and inclusive as possible, you may want to use people-first language (for example, saying <q>a person who is Queer</q> rather than <q>a Queer person</q>). To learn more about deciding when to use people-first language, read <xref ref="writewithequity" text="title"/>. What follows is a list of basic terms and definitions that describe diverse genders and sexualities.</p>

Many people take hormones and some undergo surgery, but neither of these medical treatments is requisite for a transgender identity.</p>
                        <p>It is inappropriate to use transgender as a noun (e.g., a transgender) or to use the term transgendered.</p>

This period and what occurs within it differ from person to person. Do not use the term <q>sex change,</q> as it obscures the difference between sex and gender and does not represent all transition experiences. <q>Sex reassignment surgery</q> (SRS) and <q>gender-affirming surgery</q> are two (among many more) acceptable alternative terms.</p>

            <title>Language Toward Socioeconomic Inclusivity</title>
            <p>Unless you're a sociologist or economist, writing about social class can be difficult because information about non-technical, correct, and respectful language can be hard to come by. While the last few years have given rise to more conversations around race, gender, and sexuality, discussions of socioeconomic differences have been comparatively lacking. Socioeconomic status is an important topic in many social sciences and relates to a variety of identities people may hold such as being a first-generation college student, being homeless, or being rich or poor.</p>
            <p>Although American individualism and Protestant ethic suggest that both affluence and poverty are the responsibility of the individual, the reality is that socioeconomic status is largely structural and linked to opportunities in education, employment, home ownership, and so on. As such, it is important to note that inequities in socioeconomic status are often intertwined with identities like race, gender, and sexuality. Disparities in education and employment, moreover, produce and reproduce structures of poverty and affluence.</p>
            <example>
                <title>Inherited Socioeconomic Status</title>
                <p>College-educated parents are likely to be able to afford to live in a neighborhood with an adequately funded, high-functioning school<mdash/>or to be able to send their children to an adequately funded, high-functioning school. Their children are likely to learn and internalize language and mannerisms at home that are consistent with the language and mannerisms at school, and thus are more likely to succeed<mdash/>and, if they don't succeed initially, their parents are likely in a good position to advocate for them or to help them strategize ways to succeed.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, parents who are not college-educated are less likely to be able to send their children to an adequately funded, high-functioning school. Their children are less likely to go to school already knowing the language and mannerisms that are expected in school, and so those children must work harder in school to learn the things that schools expect. The farther along the children go in school, the more important it is that their hard work pays off, and if they don't succeed initially, their parents are likely not to know from experience how to advocate for them or to help them strategize ways to succeed.</p>
                <p>While vastly un-nuanced, this example demonstrates how social class embodies generations of oppression and oppressing. Statistically, people in the United States tend to end up in socioeconomic positions similar to those of their parents, so both affluence and poverty tend to be cyclical.</p>
            </example>
            <p>Writing about socioeconomic status or class without acknowledging inequalities in opportunities does injustice to the people that those inequalities affect. Avoiding classist language is an important step toward changing the classist ideologies that underlie and reproduce the structural inequalities that lead to economic disparity.</p>

        <subsection xml:id="inclusivity-religious">
            <title>Language Toward Religious Inclusivity</title>
            <p>The majority of people in the world identify with a religion, and most religions spans huge swaths of the globe and encompass very diverse groups of people. Additionally, religions are often interpreted and practiced very differently depending on the cultural context, and people may identify with a religion religiously, culturally and/or ethnically. All of these factors make it complicated to write about religion inclusively and without over-generalization.</p>
            <p>Despite this complexity, it is important to take the time to learn about the nuances of religion in order to avoid perpetuating stereotypes and spreading misinformation that contributes to religious discrimination or persecution. Both religious discrimination (the treatment of a person or group differently because of their religion) and religious persecution (the systematic mistreatment or discrimination of an individual or group because of their religion) have long and persisting histories. From the forced conversion of Native Americans to Christianity by European Americans in the late 19th century, to the murder of millions of Jewish people during the Holocaust, to modern U.S. immigration policies that disproportionately affect Muslim people, the histories of systematic religious oppression are extensive. More subtle forms of discrimination are also ongoing: at the University of Puget Sound not only has anti-Semitic graffiti been found on campus as recently as Spring of 2018, but members of the University of Puget Sound Jewish Student Union described in an interview how campus members continue to make assumptions about them, such as that they eat kosher, speak Hebrew, attend a synagogue, or are good with money, because of their Jewish identity. As writers and people, we all have a sphere of influence in which we can bring awareness about the complexity of religious identity in order to foster a culture of religious Inclusivity. Writing about a religion without being informed about it can unknowingly fuel religious discrimination. Therefore, although complex, it's is vital to take the steps to learn about the nuances of religion before writing about it.</p>

                    <p>It's important if people are going to be writing about anti-Semitism that they don't refer to the Holocaust as the only example, or place it in a historical vacuum and say that it doesn't exist anymore. Generalizing and historicizing anti-Semitism is another form of anti-Semitism that erases anti-Semitic acts happening in the world right now.</p>

            <p>A common misconception about religious communities is that there is a single experience shared by everyone in the community, and that there is agreement about how the religion should be practiced or interpreted. In reality, there is a lot of disagreement within most faith communities about religious beliefs, practices, interpretations, and even about who belongs to the community. For example, as a member of the University of Puget Sound Jewish Student Union emphasizes, there is not a united stance on Israel that is shared by all Jewish people. Individuals within a religious community have experiences, beliefs, and practices as diverse as the individuals themselves. Individuals' and groups' religious practices are informed by their cultural context as well as their other identities (for more on how identities interact see <xref ref="intersectionality"/>). For instance,  as a member of the University of Puget Sound Muslim Student Union points out, a Sunni Muslim, upper-middle class, merchant family from Damascus, Syria will likely have very different perspectives and practices than a Muslim farmer from Sinai, Egypt,despite their shared Muslim identity. For this reason, it is important not to oversimplify the experiences, beliefs and practices of individuals and religious communities. When writing about a religion, take care to be precise about what specific sects you are referencing, and donâ€™t generalize one group or individualâ€™s experience as representative of others just because they fall under the same umbrella religious term.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Christianity is certainly a dominant identity, but that doesn't mean that it should be written about as though it is an inherently oppressive identity. Christianity has often been used oppressively  by various regimes including the U.S., but what tends to be ignored is that Christianity has also been used to work against oppression. Many of the social organizations and activist movements we know and love today began within Christianity, for example the environmentalist movement, the labor movement, and the civil rights movement of the 1950's and 60's began in churches. Writing about Christianity as if it was just one oppressive, dominant entity erases a lot of history and complexity. At its core, Christianity is just another human identity and should therefore be written about with nuance.</p>

            <p>Another intricacy about religious identity is that people donâ€™t always identify with a religion religiously; they may also identify with it culturally and/or ethnically. For example, someone who is raised Catholic but identifies as atheist may identify as culturally Catholic. While they may not share the same religious beliefs and practices as the Catholic community they were raised in, their worldview was nevertheless shaped by growing up in a Catholic community. For instance, their familiarity with the practice of celebrating Christmas and Easter and participating in Catholic practices such as Confirmation and Lent gives them a different cultural context than would growing up, for example, in a Hindu community.</p>

            <p>Each of our fundamental worldviews are as intricate as the various identities, experiences, relationships, and cultural contexts that shape them. Because of this, making comparisons between a worldview you hold and that of a religion you are learning about, although comfortable, may be wildly misleading. A member of the University of Puget Sound Muslim Student Union gives the example of equating Sunnis and Shiites with Catholics and Protestants, the Mosque with the Church, and Muslim forms of prayer with Christian forms. In these cases, although someone who is religiously or culturally Christian may think it is helpful to compare what they are learning about Islam to what they know about Christianity, such associations impose a Christian worldview onto Islam, prohibiting the Christian from accurately understanding these aspects of Islam. Making false equivalencies frequently leads people to make inaccurate interpretations and assumptions about religions. In order to avoid making false equivalencies, be wary of making direct comparisons between your religious perspective and that of one you are less familiar with, and be aware that your worldview may inhibit you from interpreting a religious text, practice, or belief in the same way someone with a different worldview would. Also, when learning about a religion, read sources that are written by people who identify with that religion, rather than texts exclusively by people interpreting it through different religious perspectives.</p>

        <title>Writing and Correctness</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>At the beginning of this chapter, we note that language use is part of the work of equity and inclusion. One way we advance equity is by supporting linguistic diversity on our campus. Linguistic diversity refers to the many varieties of English that people use to communicate and  which are intimately connected to writers' and speakers' identities. Members of the Puget Sound community come from multiple geographic locations and cultures that use a variety of linguistic structures to communicate ideas. These structures may overlap in some ways and diverge in others. These structures also overlap and diverge from specific varieties of English that are used in academic settings. By supporting linguistic diversity, we acknowledge the expansive nature of language, we avoid reproducing inequities inherent in a linguistic monoculture, and we encourage the inclusion of minoritized voices in academic discourse on our campus.</p>
        </introduction>
        <subsection xml:id="SAE">
            <title>Standard American English</title>
            <p>Standard American English (<init>SAE</init>) (also called Academic English, or <init>AE</init>; Mainstream American English, or <init>MAE</init>; and Standard Edited American English, or <init>SEAE</init>) is a variety of English that is held in high esteem. <init>SAE</init> exists primarily as a written form of English and is the form of English that is usually used on campus in our written papers, speeches, lectures, and presentations. Of course, the notion that <init>SAE</init> is <q>standard</q> is contested: On the one hand, because language changes constantly, there is no one moment in time when all users of <init>SAE</init> can agree completely on what the standard is; on the other, <init>SAE</init> is not truly <q>American</q> in that it is not the language of all Americans and has often been used to normalize white, middle- and upper-class language systems and to denigrate language systems that differ from them (and that hence, become <q>non-standard</q> and <q>improper</q>). And even within the basic category of <init>SAE</init>, there are more specific conventions regarding language that distinguish a science class, for example, from a class in humanities.</p>
            <p>If we support linguistic diversity, we accept that language is not static, that we will encounter words and expressions that come from a variety of disciplines and cultural communities. Merriam Webster defines <url href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/language">language</url> as the methods of combining words as understood by a community. By contrast, a <url href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dialect">dialect</url> is defined as a regional variety of a language. While scholars acknowledge distinctions between a language and dialect, the line between the two is not always clear or without problems. One flippant way of explaining the difference between a dialect and a language is that <q>a language is a dialect with an army and a navy</q>; in his essay <url href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/difference-between-language-dialect/424704/"><articletitle>What's a Language, Anyway?</articletitle></url> linguist John McWhorter elaborates, arguing that there is no objective difference between a language and dialect, that the realities of speech are more complicated than these definitions allow.</p>
            <p>We can better understand the status of <init>SAE</init> and the role of linguistic diversity in advancing equity and inclusion by considering the history of African American English (<init>AAE</init>), a variety of English spoken by some African Americans. <init>AAE</init> has been researched and written about extensively, more than other varieties of English, and two respected scholars of <init>AAE</init> are John Rickford of Stanford University and Geneva Smitherman of Michigan State University. Like most spoken languages, <init>AAE</init> is rule-governed and systematic, although the system is too complicated and vast to summarize here. Today, <init>AAE</init> is accepted as a variety of English, but it was rejected as a language in the past and it has been and continues to be maligned using racist ideas about black speech and intelligence. Two highly politicized cases about the use of <init>AAE</init> in public schools are <url href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/473/1371/2148458/"><pubtitle>Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School Children v. Ann Arbor School District Board</pubtitle></url> from 1979 and <url href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/21/us/black-english-plan-baffles-some-students-in-oakland.html"><em>Oakland Unified School District's 1996 resolution</em></url> to use <init>AAE</init>. In both cases, the use of <init>AAE</init> by educators as a way to affirm the validity of <init>AAE</init> and to help students learn <init>SAE</init> was considered controversial. It is helpful to know this history when considering <init>AAE</init> in academic contexts.</p>
            <p>In addition to <init>SAE</init>, other rule-governed varieties of American English include Chicano English (also called Mexican American English), Cajun English, Hawaiian Pidgin (also called Hawaiian Pidgin English and Hawaiian Creole English), and Southern White American English. These varieties of English not only have some different vocabulary than <init>SAE</init> but also<mdash/>and more importantly<mdash/>have some different grammatical rules than <init>SAE</init>. American Sign Language (<init>ASL</init>), too, has a different grammatical structure than written <init>SAE</init>.</p>

        <subsection xml:id="pronoun-identity">
            <title>Pronouns and Correctness</title>
            <p>A pronoun is a word (including I, you, me, he, she, and they) that refers to a noun, when it's unwieldy to keep referring to that noun by name. When pronouns refer to and represent people, pronouns are usually connected to gender identity, which is the internal, personal perception that one has about one's own gender. A person may identify on either end of the gender spectrum (man/woman or boy/girl), or in between or outside of it (see <xref ref="gender-inclusivity"/> and <xref ref="lgbtq-inclusivity"/> for more). Using appropriate pronouns is as important as referring to a person by the correct name.</p>
            <paragraphs xml:id="singular-they">
                <title>They As a Singular Pronoun</title>
                <p>Using appropriate pronouns, though, is complicated because gender-neutral singular pronouns are being debated actively at the moment, and, as we discuss above, many people are now arguing that gender is not even relevant in many of the circumstances in which we once emphasized it (for instance, how often is it really important to know whether the person in a sales position is a <q>saleswoman</q> or a <q>salesman</q>?). Debate over gender and pronouns is not new; people have been proposing gender-neutral pronouns <url href="http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/essays/epicene.htm">since at least the mid-nineteenth century</url>. However, the need for adequate pronouns in English has become more pressing as trans people have become more visible and as the idea of gender identity has been discussed more openly.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <p>People who identify as female typically use she/her pronouns, and those who identify as male usually use he/him pronouns. Individuals whose gender identity does not fit the binary sometimes use they/them pronouns, and<mdash/>more generally<mdash/><q>they</q> is becoming increasingly accepted as a gender-neutral, third-person singular pronoun.</p>
            <note>
                <title>Our Stance on <q>They</q></title>
                    <p>In this book, we use <q>they</q> as a gender-neutral pronoun in circumstances when the gender of a person is unknown (for example, <q>Please ask each of the students what they would like for dessert</q>) or when that person identifies as neither male nor female (for example, <q>Do you know my friend Ari? They are a math major</q>).</p>
            </note>
            <p>Pronouns are important representations of people's gender identity. If you don't know what pronouns someone uses, simply ask them, <q>What pronouns do you use?</q> If you accidentally use the wrong pronoun, apologize, correct yourself, and remember for next time.</p>
