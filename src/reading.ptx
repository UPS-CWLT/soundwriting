    <title>How to Read</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>Yes, we know. You learned to read over a decade ago! Why is there a chapter on reading? This chapter is not so much about literacy as it is about strategy. Since you'll likely have to read <em>a lot</em> during your time at Puget Sound, it's helpful to have some strategies that will make reading and researching as quick and painless as possible.</p>
        <p>Reading is the first step to writing, and any skilled writer has undoubtedly read a lot. The first thing you need to remember is to <em>do your course readings</em>! Not only will you be completing work that will help you in your courses, but you'll also get a better feel for writing in that discipline. Your future self will thank you! Reading your course readings also prepares you for researching in that discipline. Especially when you're doing research, being strategic about what and how you read is essential to producing quality content at a pace that isn't agonizingly slow. For more details, tips, and some bad jokes, read on!</p>

        <title>Finding, Skimming, and Reading Sources</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>Congratulations on finding some sources (see <xref ref="BEAM" text="title"/>)! Now what? Take a picture of all your books and post it to Instagram or Twitter so everyone knows that you're taking college seriously! <url href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/totheheights">#totheheights</url> It can be intimidating to have collected piles of useful sources only to realize how much time it will take you to read through them. But do you really need to read all of them completely? The way you approach any source will depend on the nature of the source, the amount of time you have, and the information you seek.</p>
            <sidebyside width="50%">
                <image source="images/HR-StackOfBooks"/>
            </sidebyside>
            <p>Of the sources you'll be working with, many will be primary and secondary. Sometimes it can be difficult to determine whether a source is primary or secondary. For instance, if you're writing an essay for a literature course on Shakespeare's <pubtitle>King Lear</pubtitle>, then <pubtitle>King Lear</pubtitle> would likely be your primary source. However, if you're writing a paper analyzing patterns in the critical reception of <pubtitle>King Lear</pubtitle>, then you may find yourself working with what would otherwise be considered secondary sources<mdash/>critical interpretations of the play, for instance<mdash/>and analyzing those. (For more information on the types of sources, see this <url href="http://collins.pugetsound.edu/Research_Fundamentals_Sources/story.html">Research Fundamentals guide</url> from Collins Library.) That said, in order to find any source, it's important to know what kind of source you're looking for. Think about the kind of information you need, and come up with a list of search terms<mdash/>particular words and concepts you think would return helpful titles (see <xref ref="research-tips-tricks"/> for advice on refining search terms).</p>
        </introduction>
        <subsection xml:id="reading-finding-primary">
            <title>Primary Sources</title>
            <p>Primary sources are the texts (though they aren't always <q>texts</q>) upon which you perform the most analysis and upon which you base your argument. It is always desirable to read your primary sources carefully and in their entirety. It's hard to write an argument about a book, for instance, without knowing how it ends or who one of its main characters is. Reading primary sources completely is especially important for essays that depend on analyses of a text's language. You can't analyze language that you haven't read! (The same holds for non-textual <q>texts</q> such as paintings, musical compositions, or scientific data<mdash/>spend time with the source, and think about what its parts add up to.)</p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection xml:id="reading-finding-secondary">
            <title>Secondary Sources</title>
            <p>Secondary sources are texts that you use to supplement your argument in some way: by establishing a theoretical premise, by providing a point of reference or departure, or by providing some historical or biographical context (to name a few). They are the secondary objects of your analysis and do not comprise the bulk of your argument. Though it's often rewarding to read secondary sources in their entirety, it's not always practical. The following are some tips for getting the most out of your secondary sources:</p>
            <list xml:id="list-reading-strategies-secondary">
                <title>Strategies for Finding Secondary Sources</title>
                <ul>
                    <li><title>Figure out what you're looking for</title>
                        <p>
                            Because secondary sources are supplementary, it shouldn't be too difficult to identify what information you need. Writing a paper on the presidency of Barack Obama and need a source that describes the international response to his election? Refresh yourself on these <xref ref="list-research-finding-sources"/>, and dive in! Some useful search terms might include: Obama, election, international, response.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><title>Read the introduction and the conclusion</title>
                        <p>
                            This should give you a good idea of the starting point and end point of the source's argument and its major points. Assess the usefulness of the source based on these sections. If the source doesn't look like it will be of great use to you, put it to the side. For instance, if you found a source called <pubtitle>The Military Legacy of the Obama Administration</pubtitle>, you might browse through it for a hidden nugget of information, but chances are the source may not be the most helpful to you.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><title>Identify relevant passages</title>
                        <p>
                            Browse headings and subheadings, or chapters, if your source is a book. Skim any relevant sections for key words (see <xref ref="skimming"/>). Find a heading that reads <q>European Reactions to the Election of Barack Obama</q>? Mark it!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><title>Search for key words</title>
                        <p>
                            It's possible to do this manually (picture the word in your head and let your eyes roam the page), but it's far easier to do electronically. If your source is electronic, find the search function on your computer and type in key words: Obama, election, international, response.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><title>If your source has an index, browse it for key words</title>
                        <p>
                            The index is at the back of the book, and it should refer you to specific pages on which the concept is discussed. The index is also a good way to look for relevant words that you may not have thought of.
                        </p>
                    </li>

            <title>Skimming</title>
            <p>In general, the more actively and patiently you approach a text, the more comprehensive your reading will be. However, sometimes it is highly impractical to read a source in its entirety. Whether you're doing some preliminary reading to familiarize yourself with the existing scholarly discussion or to cram for class, skimming can be a good way to extract the main idea of the text in as little time as possible.</p>

                    <li><title>Read the introduction and the conclusion</title>
                        <p>
                            Doing this will give you a sense of the general trajectory of the argument.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><title>Read the first sentence of every paragraph</title>
                        <p>
                            This sentence is usually sufficient to tell you what the main point of the paragraph is and whether you should spend time reading it.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><title>Read both horizontally and vertically</title>
                        <p>
                            Let your eyes roam. Look for keywords and bolded or italicized items.

                    <li><title>Read for points and not for analysis</title>
                        <p>
                            Though it's always good to understand how the author arrived at a claim, it is more productive in a pinch to skip the analyses and return to them later.

        <title>Different Types of Reading</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>You will encounter numerous kinds of readings throughout your college experience (and beyond). Because there are various ways in which we use different kinds of sources, there are also several reading strategies we can use to read our sources most effectively and efficiently. One key skill is to be able to identify why you're reading a source: How will you use it, what information will you need from it, and how will you record or take notes on what you learn from it? The answers to these questions will help you decide how to read your source.</p>
        </introduction>
        <subsection xml:id="reading-types-active">
            <title>Active Reading</title>
            <p><alert>All reading you do should be active reading!</alert> In order to read critically, you must read actively. Active reading requires you to be active<mdash/>to actually do things while you read. No, you don't need to run on a treadmill while you read <pubtitle>The Odyssey</pubtitle> (although that would be interesting). Instead, your mind needs to be active doing things that keep you engaged in the reading, including (but not at all limited to!) writing marginal notes, underlining, using a symbolic system, asking questions, and summarizing thoughts or sections.</p>
            <sidebyside width="50%">
                <image source="images/HR-ActiveReading"/>
            </sidebyside>
            <p>You might be muttering to yourself, <q>But reading is enough work!</q> But know that active reading helps you understand and remember what a text says the first time you read it, so you don't have to waste your time reading the same paragraph over and over again. Plus, having a pen in your hand as you read makes it easier for you to write funny comments in the margins as you get frustrated (we all do it). Just be careful not to fall asleep with your pen uncapped. <ellipsis/></p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection xml:id="reading-types-critical">
            <title>Reading Critically</title>
            <p>No matter the type or purpose of a source, the reading you'll be doing for your Puget Sound courses will almost always be critical. Reading critically means that you do far more than read the words on a page<mdash/>you engage with them by thinking about them. As you will read in <xref ref="forming-your-argument"/>, academic writing is all about participating in larger scholarly conversations. This participation is largely about making argumentative claims and supporting them with evidence in order to convince an audience of those claims. When you read an academic work, then, you're also participating in the scholarly conversation around that work. As a result, reading critically requires you to read and evaluate the author's claims and evidence. While it isn't your job to treat your sources as if you were a movie or restaurant critic, you should be aware of the places in which the author's argument is unconvincing, contradictory, or contentious. (Note: Critical reading for some primary sources can be slightly different, but we will address those differences in the <q>close reading</q> section that follows.)</p>

                <title>Close Reading</title>
                <p>Close reading most frequently occurs in literary studies, but you can also use close reading skills for other disciplines, such as history or sociology. Like reading critically and actively, reading closely enables you to engage with the text on a much deeper level than if you simply skimmed or scanned it. Using the critical and active reading skills you've developed, you now need to add in an additional component: close analysis. You perform a close analysis of a formal text in the same way you would agonize over the meaning of the word <q>okay</q> in a text message from your new romantic interest. In both cases, <q>close analysis</q> means that you are reading a relatively small portion of text in extreme detail. Perhaps the most important thing to remember about close readings is that you are not only trying to describe the text. While describing the text may be an important part of your analysis, you need to do just that<mdash/>analyze! Your analysis extends beyond the literal meaning of the words on the page to the underlying meaning the writer is conveying.</p>

                </sidebyside>
                <p>The text that you have read closely is your evidence. To convince your audience of your argument, you must take careful and detailed notes (<ie/>, doing careful and detailed active reading). By including all of the necessary analysis and textual examples, you can tell your reader exactly how you've interpreted a passage.</p>

            <title>Reading in the Sciences</title>
                <p>Reading in the sciences (social, earth, hard, soft, or otherwise) can be a whole different beast than reading literature, historical documents, or humanities-based secondary sources. If you've ever tried to read a peer reviewed scientific article you may have found yourself feeling lost and confused by the technical words and abbreviations. But have no fear! By using the following strategies, you can become a savvy reader of scientific articles.</p>

                            While you may not absorb it all on a first or even a second reading, the title and abstract of a scientific article offer a snapshot of the whole article. Use the title and abstract as a mental guide to lead you through the text.

                    </li>

                        <p>
                            Make sure to read the last paragraph of the introduction because the research question of the paper will usually be there. Then, skim the discussion/conclusion to determine if or how the goals projected in the introduction were accomplished.

                            While the authors of the paper are motivated to tell a compelling story about their data, it's harder to manipulate a figure. Spend some time reading the figure captions and understanding how the data matches up with what the authors are saying in the text.

        <title>Note-Taking Strategies</title>
        <p>Whether you're listening to an in-class lecture, reading a reading assignment, or skimming articles or books for your own research, taking good notes is essential. Notes have two main purposes: 1) to help you read actively and understand the content of the reading, and 2) to help remind your future self what was important about the reading. Though there are plenty of standardized note-taking strategies that you can use, such as Cornell notes, outlining, and mapping, in this section we will focus on deciding which strategies work for you and in which contexts specific strategies work best. For some people, the same type of notes may work in all disciplinary situations, while other people require different strategies for different disciplines or assignments. If you haven't decided which strategies work best for you, try some out and be mindful of which ones help you learn most effectively and efficiently.</p>
        <p>Before you begin reading or taking notes, ask yourself: What class are you taking notes for? Does this class require you to know a lot of specific information (<eg/>, biological processes, historical events, or literary terms), or does it focus more on understanding (<eg/>, <em>why</em> a historical event happened, <em>how</em> to find a derivative, or <em>what type</em> of research method is best for a certain situation)? While all classes have a mix of both types of information, identifying the primary type of information you'll be interacting with will help you decide what form your notes should take.</p>
        <list xml:id="list-reading-note-taking-strategies">
            <title>Strategies for Taking Notes while Reading</title>
            <ul>
                <li><title>Identify the main argument of the paper or chapter</title>
                    <p> The main argument of a paper or chapter is also called a <term>thesis<idx>thesis</idx></term> (see <xref ref="main-claim" text="title"/>). The thesis will help guide your reading and note-taking by telling you what about the argument is important and what you need to pay attention to. You can usually find a thesis in the abstract and near the end of the introduction. If you're having trouble locating the thesis, you might also read the conclusion (don't worry about spoilers<mdash/>usually academic writing is up front about the conclusions of an investigation).</p>
                </li>
                <li><title>Identify the main point of each paragraph</title>
                    <p> As you'll see in <xref ref="argumentation-as-process" text="title"/>, clear paragraphs begin with topic sentences. The purpose of a topic sentence is to tell the reader what the paragraph will be about. Use this to your advantage! Like a mini-thesis for each paragraph, topic sentences will guide your reading by telling you what information is worthy to note.</p>
                </li>
                <li><title>Keep the discipline and class in mind</title>
                    <p> You can't remember everything from every reading, so be strategic about what you pay attention to. Does your discipline focus on data? Dates? Or should you pay more attention to the syntax and voice of the reading? Knowing what you're looking for helps you take better and more useful notes.</p>
                </li>
                <li><title>Keep yourself and your personal preferences in mind</title>
                    <p> If you hate outlining because you don't get it, then play around with note-taking strategies until you find what makes the most sense to you, whatever the discipline. If you can't memorize information in your notes and need to use flashcards, then do that. As long as you're recording all of the information that you need to successfully recall information and understand concepts, don't worry about what you're <q>supposed</q> to be doing.</p>

        <p>Highlight and underline enough, but not too much. We know that you've heard this a million times before, but don't waste your highlighter ink by highlighting unnecessarily! The point of highlighting is to tell yourself what's important, so highlighting everything doesn't do you much good.</p>
        <insight>
            <p>If you just can't resist highlighting, then make sure you have a way to indicate to your future self (who will inevitably be reading the highlighted work) which pieces of information are simply highlighted because you think they are interesting and which ones are highlighted because they're important. You might use underlining, asterisks, or other symbols to denote this difference.</p>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Marginal Notes and Annotations</title>
            <p>Take lots of marginal notes! Marginal notes are great tools to ensure that you're reading actively. By writing your own thoughts about the reading and summaries of the author's argument, you're engaging with the reading on a level beyond simply reading the words on the page. Not only will marginal notes help you stay focused, but they'll also be useful when you have to look back over a reading to study for a test or research for a paper.</p>
            <p>The most important thing to remember when you're annotating a source is that what you do doesn't matter as much as how and why you do it. For instance, it makes no difference whether you use asterisks or smiley faces to indicate that something is important; it only matters that you know what it means now and you'll know what it means later. You can highlight, use different color pens, make different symbols or words, use sticky notes or tabs, or dog-ear your pages (unless you're using a library book). Figure out a symbolic system that you like, and then stick to it!</p>
        </paragraphs>
        <insight>
            <!-- <title>Tip</title> -->
            <p>If you're getting bored with a reading, try writing a few funny comments in the margins. You could even use a curse word. Not only will you give yourself a nice laugh, but the study break will help you refocus and keep reading. These initial emotional reactions to a reading will also help you remember it better in the long term because you're interacting with the reading in new and interesting ways.</p>

        <title>How to Read Writing Prompts</title>
        <p>One of things that makes Puget Sound such a vibrant intellectual space is the diversity of pedagogical styles represented on campus; as students, we can attest that this diversity makes for more flexible and creative thinkers. That said, we know that it can be difficult to develop a consistent way to interpret and approach writing assignments when those assignments vary by professor and even by course. In this section, you'll find some tips on reading, understanding, and responding to writing assignments. You may also find it helpful to read <xref ref="discipline-specific-writing"/>.</p>
        <p>
            It's important to get started on your essay as early as you can to allow yourself the most time to develop and revise your ideas. To this effect, read through your assignment as soon as you receive it! The rest of this section is dedicated to showing you a useful framework for breaking down a writing prompt.
        </p>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>The Purpose</title>
                    <p>When approaching an assignment, it's useful to identify the purpose of the assignment. Asking yourself, <q>Why did Professor <fillin/> assign this essay?</q> can help you understand what your professor wants you to get out of this assignment. Often, professors assign written work to clarify your thinking on a topic or concept, sharpen some relevant academic skill, or both. Thus, your English professor might ask you to write an essay about Gertrude Stein to give you practice deciphering ambiguous poetry, or your sociology professor might ask you to write an autoethnography to personalize the connection between, for instance, dorm life and capitalism. Knowing why you're writing a paper<mdash/>that is, knowing that your professor is not sadistically assigning work<mdash/>actually makes writing the paper easier.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>The Work to be Done</title>
                    <p>Now that you've figured out the purpose of the assignment, it's time to identify what the assignment is asking you to do. To do so, pay attention to the active verbs of the prompt. If your prompt asks you to <q><em>Analyze</em> Lewis Carroll's <pubtitle>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</pubtitle>,</q> make sure your essay is founded on textual analysis. If your prompt asks you to <q><em>Compare</em> the timelines of the Korean War and the Vietnam War,</q> make sure your paper compares. Identifying these active verbs can can give you a basic sense of how your professor will evaluate your essay<mdash/>Does it analyze the novel? Does it compare the wars?<mdash/>and can guide your writing to meet those expectations.</p>
                    <p>Also, identify what type of evidence that you'll need to substantiate your argument: If your professor explicitly asks for a <q>statistical analysis of American automobile consumption in the past decade,</q> make sure you draw on statistics. (Often, this information is implied in the language of the prompt: When a prompt asks you to analyze <pubtitle>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</pubtitle>, you know you'll be working with the novel.) If you don't know what type of evidence your professor expects you to use, ask.</p>
                    <insight>
                        <p>Once you know what your professor is looking for, make a list of things to keep in mind as you write: Having this list for easy reference will keep your paper on topic and help you to foreground the skills under evaluation.</p>

                <title>Suggestions Versus Requirements</title>
                    <p>There are things you <em>must</em> do for an assignment, and there are also things you <em>might</em> do. Professors, especially those at Puget Sound, sincerely want you to succeed. Because they're so benevolent, your professors might provide some suggestions for writing or constructing an argument in response to the prompt. These suggestions can be helpful points of departure, especially if you're having difficulty formulating a response. They're also good examples of responses that your professor would accept. If it seems like there are a lot of questions, chances are, you aren't required to answer all of them (professors don't want to read essays full of a bunch of disjointed ideas). If you're not sure whether something is required or just suggested, ask your professor.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>Key Information</title>
                    <p>Once you know the why and the how of your assignment, identify any stipulations regarding <em>length</em>, <em>citation format</em>, the <em>number of required sources</em> (both primary and secondary), and, of course, the <em>due date</em>. Knowing this information will help you to plan your approach and allocate your time: You probably shouldn't wait until Thursday night to begin outlining the six-page paper due in class on Friday. Having this information will also give you a sense of the extent and scope of your response: If you're limited to three pages, you probably won't be able to argue about the evolution of Los Angeles's urban landscape from 1980 to the present; perhaps you could focus on a single aspect<mdash/>building height<mdash/>and hold off on the rest until your 25-page final. Identifying key information can also help you to plan your essay: The tone you adopt (Is it professional or conversational?) and the background that you provide are largely determined by your <em>audience</em>: Are you writing for your professor, your peers, or the general population? Your grasp of key information can help you to contour your approach.</p>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
                <title>Your Approach</title>
                    <p>It goes without saying that assignments vary! Some professors will give you a detailed question to respond to, while others will ask you to come up with and respond to your own question. This variation can be perplexing. However, knowing how to approach either type of assignment can save you some anxiety.</p>
                    <p>Students often feel that a specific prompt requires a specific answer. This can be frustrating, especially if you feel that you don't know that answer or that you're being stifled into agreeing with your professor. While it may be the case that your prompt requires a particular answer, it is more likely that your professor will accept a variety of responses. Not only is it more interesting for your professors to evaluate 20 different responses (as opposed to 20 responses making the same point), but we also have it on good word that the joy of assigning essays comes from the variety of responses that such assignments elicit. Thus, while you should ask if you're unsure whether your assignment wants a particular answer, take comfort in the fact that what matters most to most professors is often not the answer you give but how well you argue it.</p>
                    <p>When faced with a bare prompt, students often have the opposite frustration: They don't know where to start! It can seem impossible to start on a paper when all that you're given is: <q>Write an essay on a topic related to the concerns of the course</q> (or something to this effect). Though prompts like this one can seem daunting, they also give you the most intellectual and creative freedom. Your only constraint is your ability to shape an idea of yours into an argument of relevance to the course. Adopting this frame of mind can transform what seems daunting into a liberating opportunity to demonstrate your argumentative facility. If you find yourself stuck, think about what interests you most about your course topic and make some word or concept webs (see <xref ref="the-writing-process"/>); you're likely to find something worth writing about. If you're still stuck, schedule a meeting with your professor, talk with a friend, or see a writing advisor at the <init>CWLT</init>!</p>

                <title>Questions</title>
                    <p>It's normal to have questions about your assignments. After you read through your prompt, note any questions that you have and ask your professor for clarification. When your professor realizes that they accidentally wrote <q>single-spaced</q> instead of <q>double-spaced,</q> your classmates will thank you.</p>
            </paragraphs>
        <p>Here are some examples of real prompts that we've marked up with regard to the above information:</p>
        <example>
            <title>Short Paper (Short Prompt)</title>
            <blockquote>
                <p>This is a seven-page autobiographical essay in which you explore the framing of your identity as an individual within the context of diversity in the United States. Here you may explore any aspect of your upbringing, socialization, and family ties <etc/>, to discuss the formation of your identity. As part of the process of developing this essay you are required to engage readings from the class that explore issues of identity.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Here we have a very short prompt for an essay of considerable length. As readers, we'll begin by identifying the important aspects of the assignment: it must be seven pages; it must be autobiographical with respect to identity; it must engage readings from the class; and it must be situated in the context of diversity in the United States. The assignment is unique because it is autobiographical; because we don't have much experience writing autobiographical essays, we might ask some of the following questions: How much detail should we provide? How personal can we be? What is the desired balance of autobiographical and scholarly writing? What does scholarly autobiographical writing look like? The benefit of prompts like this one is that they tend to be open-ended. We wouldn't be surprised if the answer to the questions above are of the do-what-is-most-appropriate-to-the-point-you're-making type. This type of freedom may be scary, but take advantage of the opportunity: write the essay that you want to write! There are, of course, some important details omitted; we would definitely need more information about the assignment's due date, citation style, and audience. That kind of information is often offered in class when that assignment is made. Make sure to take good notes!</p>

            <title>Engagement Papers (Medium Prompt)</title>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Middlemarch is a long novel that will take us several weeks to read (and more to digest); in addition, the bulk of the course is directed toward the seminar paper you will submit in May. To ensure that you are continually writing and processing ideas, each of you will write five Engagement Papers. The papers should be approximately 1000 words (~3 standard pages) and are due on Fridays (see schedule). At the end of each class, I will suggest possible topics to write on; I suggest you reserve a separate section of your notebook to jot these down.  The general guidelines for each of the Engagement Papers are: (1) they should <em>not</em> simply regurgitate class discussion; instead, use our discussions as a jumping off point to delve deeper into an issue, topic, passage, chapter/section of the novel; (2) they should primarily be focused on that week's reading, not on the readings of weeks ago. While you might certainly <em>link</em> developments in the week's reading to previous sections of the novel, the focus should be on the current sections. Your papers will be graded foremost for their depth of analysis, but also for their clarity and style (these are formal papers).</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>This prompt is helpful because it is explicit about its aims. The professor specifies, at the beginning, that the assignment is designed to <q>ensure that you [the student] are continually writing and processing ideas</q> in anticipation of the final, seminar paper. This information is useful, because it tells us that these essays are, for all intents and purposes, practice for the big one. The prompt is also explicit about what it expects: a paper of 1000 words, due every Friday, on the reading for that week, that engages with the novel in ways that go beyond class discussion. Finally, the assignment is transparent about its evaluative logic, with primary emphasis given to argument and secondary emphasis given to expression. There are, as always, some lingering questions, regarding, for instance, citation style and the use of secondary sources. These questions, however, are easily answered in class or during office hours.</p>

The prompt begins with an introductory statement summarizing some of the topics discussed in class and then asks you, the writer, to focus on one, formulate a question related to it, and to respond to that question by conducting research in both academic and popular sources. The prompt is open-ended and gives the writer the creative and scholarly license to pursue a project that interests them. This hands-off approach, we have noted, can be both liberating and, paradoxically, stifling. If you think that you'll have trouble getting started, try one of the brainstorming strategies that we suggested in <xref ref="brainstorming"/>. As with all assignments, you'll want to get started early. The prompt is comprehensive about the technical requirements of the paper. You may need to ask when the assignment is due and in what form (hard copy or electronic) if that information is not on the syllabus. Jot down these questions and any other questions you may have so that you do not forget to ask them. Finally, pay particular attention to the grading criteria. The professor has likely included this information to help you, the writer, to write a clear (not to mention high-scoring) essay. Because the prompt mentions four areas of assessment, be sure to make those areas as strong as possible.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><p>After reading Tobias Wolff's memoir, <pubtitle>This Boy's Life</pubtitle>, and viewing the film of the same name, write an essay in which you focus on one or more significant <em>differences</em> between scenes, characters, or other elements that appear in <em>both</em> the book and the screenplay. Does this change enhance or detract from the viewing experience of this memoir? In what ways? What meaning is meant to be conveyed? Be as specific as possible, using examples of language, imagery, music, <etc/></p></li>
                        <li><p><em>Or</em> you may wish to write about an obvious <em>omission from the memoir</em>, something important in the book which the filmmaker decided to leave out. What is gained, and what is lost? Which version tells the greater emotional truth in your opinion, and what is that truth(s)?</p></li>
                        <li><p>Or you may write about an original element of the film that is not part of the book's narrative. Does it add to or fit within the <q>dramatic arc</q> of the story? In what ways? What meaning is meant to be emphasized? Can you speculate about the filmmaker's artistic choice?</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Consider the nature of memory and what <q>fictional</q> license may be granted to an author? What parts of Wolff's narrative might be invented and what do they add? Or do they? Use examples to make your points. What might be readers' feelings toward a coming-of-age story? What is the role of catharsis in reading? How do we come out on the other side of loss or disappointment or even abuse?</p>
                <p>This 3-page, double-spaced essay is a study in comparing and contrasting. The questions/suggestions above are largely to get you thinking about memoir. You may write in first person or third. You may include the effect of the book and/or movie on yourself. Whatever subject(s) you choose, keep your focus narrow, your exploration deep (rather than writing with a wide net). Remember that you are making a case (argument) for your opinion. Use examples from the text and film to back up your thesis or motive (which I hope will be the last sentence of the first paragraph).</p>
                <p>Be sure to create an original title.</p>

            <p>This essay prompt poses a wealth of questions intended to give the writer a sense of what lines of inquiry would be intellectually rewarding. The prompt is generous in its suggestions and is deeply committed to the author's creative agency, allowing the writer to choose, for instance, between adopting a first or third person voice. This commitment to authorial agency suggests that the essay is intended, at least in part, to be exploratory; it is intended to help the writer to further develop a sense of their scholarly voice and, perhaps, to experiment with a mode of rhetorical presentation not previously employed. Of course, the prompt pairs this commitment to freedom with a number of pointed argumentative and technical suggestions (<q>Keep your focus narrow, your exploration deep</q> and <q>I hope [the thesis] will be the last sentence of the first paragraph</q>) included to highlight the important and, in the former instance, less negotiable hallmarks of successful academic writing. The prompt also foregrounds the comparative aspect of the essay, cueing the reader, in so doing, to possible organizational schemes. Overall, this prompt is exceptionally supportive of the writer; it is clear about its expectations and respectful of the writer's intellectual maturity and creative agency. It also differentiates, politely, between the creative options available to the writer and the more well-established expectations of academic writing.</p>
