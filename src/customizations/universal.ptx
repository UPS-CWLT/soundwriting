    <custom name="course-guides">Your library likely has course guides or subject guides that are created by the research librarians for you to use. They have a lot of great information that can be very helpful for you in your research process. For instance, they can help you figure out whether your source is scholarly or popular, and whether it's primary, secondary, or tertiary. They also can point you to which databases you should be using and give you tips on how to use them. If you get stuck in your process, the course guides also have the contact information of the librarian working with your class, as well as that of peer research advisors.</custom>
    <custom name="CWLT-time-chart"></custom>
    <custom name="database-info">The general library search engine may seem like it has every source you could possibly need. While it can be very helpful, there are many databases to which the library provides access. Each of these databases is specifically catered to a particular topic (or topics), which means that you won't find as many unrelated articles as you would with a general search. For the same reason, you may also find sources more pertinent to your research topic by using more specific databases.</custom>

        <p><q>My favorite coffeeshop is a relaxing place to study; it is calm, quiet, and has lots of windows.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, the attributes <q>calm</q> and <q>quiet</q> equally share the verb <q>is</q>: the coffeeshop <q>is calm</q> and <q>is quiet.</q> However, the last attribute in the series (<q>has lots of windows</q>), departs from this structure by introducing another verb, <q>has,</q> to characterize the attribute <q>lots of windows,</q> throwing the series out of balance. If <q>is</q> is applied equally to each attribute, the coffeeshop <q>is calm,</q> <q>is quiet,</q> and <q>is has lots of windows.</q> To fix this mixed word form, you must do one of two things: 1) either break up the attributes into two different items using the conjunction <q>and</q> or 2) arrange the attributes so they share a single verb and adhere to the parallel structure.</p>
                <p>
                    Examples of these fixes are shown below:

    <custom name="rain-productivity-1">On the other hand, the argument <q>Rain influences the walking rates of students at my univeristy differently between the months of January and February</q> might be too specific a topic to gather substantive research on or make a meaningful claim about. Consider instead the argument <q>Rain has both positive and negative effects on students<rsq/> physical and emotional well-being.</q> This statement is both researchable and takes a clear stance about the influence of rain on student behavior.</custom>
    <custom name="rain-productivity-2">In order to make a strong argument, you generally need a substantial amount of strong evidence to back it up. But let's say you want to write about the negative effects of rainfall on the emotional well-being of students at your university. You go to the library, talk to a librarian, look through the shelves, skim around the website, and even peek into the archives, but the only thing you can find is a couple of articles published in school newspaper in the early 2000s. This probably won't be enough to substantiate your claim. Instead, you might try refining your argument to the negative effects of rainfall on the emotional well-being of college students in general. Suddenly, a mass of published scholarly sources on the subject appear on the library search engine. Hooray! You may now have enough evidence to substantiate your argument<mdash/>and you'll be creating new knowledge by considering how the general research applies in your particular context.</custom>

Whether you're just starting to think of a topic or nearing the end of your process, the librarians can get you the help you need.</custom>
