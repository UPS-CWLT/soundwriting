While Primo can be very helpful, there are more than 200 other databases to which the library provides access. Each of these databases is specifically catered to a particular topic (or topics), which means that you won't find as many unrelated articles as you would in Primo. For the same reason, you may also find sources more pertinent to your research topic by using more specific databases. To figure out which database you need, try checking out <url href="https://research.pugetsound.edu/?b=t">research and course guides</url><fn><c>research.pugetsound.edu</c></fn>.</school-custom>

For instance, they can help you figure out whether your source is scholarly or popular, and whether it's primary, secondary, or tertiary. They also can point you to which databases you should be using and give you tips on how to use them. If you get stuck in your process, the course guides also have the contact information of the liaison librarian working with your class, as well as that of the <url href="http://research.pugetsound.edu/peerresearch">peer research advisor</url>.</school-custom>

    <school-custom type="rain-productivity">In order to make a strong argument, you generally need a substantial amount of strong evidence to back it up. But let's say you want to write about the negative effects of rainfall on the emotional well-being of Puget Sound students. You go to Collins Memorial Library, visit a liaison librarian, look through the shelves, skim around in Summit, and even peek into the <url href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/academics/academic-resources/collins-memorial-library/archives/">archives</url>, but the only thing you can find is a couple of articles published in <pubtitle>The Trail</pubtitle> in the early 2000s. This probably won't be enough to substantiate your claim. Instead, you might try refining your argument to the negative effects of rainfall on the emotional well-being of college students in general. Suddenly, a mass of published scholarly sources on the subject appear on the Collins search engine. Hooray! You may now have enough evidence to substantiate your argument<mdash/>and you'll be creating new knowledge by considering how the general research applies in your particular context.</school-custom>

        <p><q>Oppenheimer is a relaxing place to study; it is calm, quiet, and has lots of windows.</q></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In this sentence, the attributes <q>calm</q> and <q>quiet</q> equally share the verb <q>is</q>: Oppenheimer <q>is calm</q> and <q>is quiet.</q> However, the last attribute in the series (<q>has lots of windows</q>), departs from this structure by introducing another verb, <q>has,</q> to characterize the attribute <q>lots of windows,</q> throwing the series out of balance. If <q>is</q> is applied equally to each attribute, Oppenheimer <q>is calm,</q> <q>is quiet,</q> and <q>is has lots of windows.</q> To fix this mixed word form, you must do one of two things: 1) either break up the attributes into two different items using the conjunction <q>and</q> or 2) arrange the attributes so they share a single verb and adhere to the parallel structure.</p>

In doing so, we aim to understand and actively respond to the ways organizational aspects of our society and of our own university often work against those principles, excluding some groups and individuals from our community while including others. The work of diversity, accordingly, seeks to account for and redress deeply embedded historical practices and legacies, forms of cultural and social representation, and institutional policies and processes that can systematically exclude groups or individuals from full participation in higher education and the considerable benefits it offers.</p>
