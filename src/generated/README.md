## Generated Directory

Sound Writing has no images generated from source description languages (TikZ, Asymptote, etc.).  It does have automatically generated preview images of YouTube videos.

If these are ever removed (replaced by hand-crafted preview images) leave this file behind (suitably edited). This directory needs to be available for the PreTeXt managed directory scheme.  And this file helps revision control know about the directory.
