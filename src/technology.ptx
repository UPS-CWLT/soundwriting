    <title>Using Technology</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>As people with butterfinger typing who (more often than we'd like to admit) accidentally hit the <q>delete</q> key after highlighting entire new paragraphs we've just written, we'll be the first to admit it: TECHNOLOGY IS HARD (and thank goodness for <q>Edit-Undo</q>). And with our academic and social lives becoming increasingly dependent on a wider variety of technological resources for researching, sharing, and disseminating information, maintaining a basic level of computer literacy is essential for students now more than ever. But whether it's using Microsoft Word to spell-check your writing or trying to keep track of all your final research paper sources, technology can also be a lifesaver. Here we've compiled a list of tips and tricks to help you use the software programs available to you as efficiently (and with as little hair tearing out) as possible.</p>

        <title>Microsoft Word</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>At this point in your academic career, you are likely acquainted with at least one word processor. Many computers come with a license for <url href="https://products.office.com/en-us/word">Microsoft Word</url> and those that do not may use <url href="https://www.apple.com/pages/">Apple Pages</url> or <url href="https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/writer/">LibreOffice Writer</url> (both of which are free), among others. Also, there are freeware options available online for your word processing needs (<eg/>, <url href="https://products.office.com/en-us/office-online/documents-spreadsheets-presentations-office-online">Microsoft Office Online</url>, <url href="https://www.icloud.com">iCloud Pages</url>, and <url href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/">Google Docs</url>). If you are looking for a word processor, it's best to try out different ones and use the one that works best for you. <custom item="microsoft-word"/> The exact tips and tricks presented here may not translate across applications, but most word processors will have similar functions.</p>

            <title>Spell-Check Errors</title>
                <image source="images/LM-Spellcheck" width="50%"><description>A cartoon of a computer has speech bubbles with the following text: "Don’t just depend on me for spellcheck… Remember to do it yourself as well!"</description></image>
            <p>Computer technologies have undeniably improved the speed and accuracy of our writing abilities, particularly through the use of automatic spelling and grammar checkers in many word processors. While these checkers can be useful, it is easy to become over-reliant on these technologies as a replacement of individual proofreading. We often forget that computers can't read our minds. In fact, many simple spelling and grammar errors actually can be <em>caused</em> by an over-dependence on auto-checkers, with word processors replacing your misspelled words with incorrect suggestions based on common Web word-distortions. For instance, a sentence stating, <q>I definantly saw something fishy going on</q> would be auto-corrected to <q>I defiantly saw something fishy going on,</q> which has a meaning different than what the writer originally intended (<q>definitely</q>). If you use spell-check or grammar-check, look individually at the suggestions your word processor makes, rather than accepting all the corrections at once. It's also important to remember that computer auto-checkers, while useful, should not be used as a replacement for manual proofreading. Carefully read through your document, give it to a friend, and/or take it to the <custom item="tutoring-center-url"/> for some help with proofreading strategies (though don't expect the <custom item="tutoring-center-acronym"/> to actually do all the proofreading for you). Below is a list of commonly misspelled words that often are auto-corrected to very different words.</p>

            <title>Inserting Footnotes</title>
            <p>Let's face it: footnotes can be a pain. Luckily, your word processor has some handy tricks for making adding footnotes relatively pain free!</p>
            <p>Let's say you have a couple paragraphs with some source evidence you'd like to cite using footnotes.</p>
                <image source="images/tech-39.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows a screenshot of a microsoft word document with two paragraphs of text, including some text that is quoted from an outside source.</description></image>
            <p>To add a footnote, simply place your cursor at the end of the sentence containing that piece of evidence (AFTER THE PERIOD), open the <q>References</q> tab, and select <q>Insert Footnote.</q></p>
                <image source="images/tech-40.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows the same screenshot from the previous image, but the toolbar along the top of the program has been switched to "references." A red box and arrow emphasize the "Insert footnote" option in the toolbar. Another red arrow indicates where the cursor should be placed when inserting a footnote: right after the period of the sentence containing the reference.</description></image>
            <p>A small superscript number will appear after the period corresponding with the footnote sequence. At the same time, a line will appear at the bottom of the page with a small number beneath it corresponding to that footnote. You can then write the footnote citation according to the appearance order of the citation (for more on how to write footnotes, see <xref ref="citations"/>).</p>
                <image source="images/tech-41.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows a screenshot of the same word document of the previous two images, but now a footnote has been added. A superscript "1" has been inserted where the cursor was in the previous image, and a footnote with citation information is at the bottom of the page. The footnote is emphasized with a red arrow and a note that reads "A footnote!"</description></image>
            <p>Every time you add a new piece of evidence, you can add subsequent footnotes by using the <q>Insert Footnote</q> function and the citations will stack sequentially at the footer of the page. However, keep in mind that if you delete the superscript number in the text, you will also delete its corresponding footnote and change the numbering sequence of subsequent footnotes (but this is also nice because it keeps track of the order for you).</p>
            <image source="images/tech-42.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows a screenshot of the same word document, but with two additional footnotes added. This demonstrates how the program adds footnotes numbered corresponding to where they appear in the text. </description></image>
            <image source="images/tech-43.png" width="100%"><description>This is the same image shown previously but with one additional footnote.</description></image>

            <title>Formatting Reference Lists, Bibliographies, and Works Cited</title>
            <p>Whether you are writing using <init>APA</init>, Chicago, or <init>MLA</init> citation style, you will most likely be required to include a reference list, bibliography, or works cited (respectively) at the end of your paper. While keeping track of your sources and writing up references can be a daunting task (see <xref ref="citations"/> and <xref ref="zotero"/> for some very helpful tricks), formatting them using a word processor is actually less painful than it might seem. We won't go into the specific details of each citation style (again, see <xref ref="citations"/> for this), but we will talk about how to create hanging indents and how to format each source list using Word.</p>
            <p>I used to have to tab over a million times to try to create hanging indents in my works cited<mdash/>until I learned this method, and my life <em>literally</em> changed. To create a reference list, bibliography, or works cited page using hanging indents, begin with centering a References (or Bibliography or Works Cited, depending on what citation style you're using) title at the top of your page and entering your first citation beneath it (remember to keep everything double-spaced in <init>APA</init> and <init>MLA</init> and single-spaced with a blank line after each entry in Chicago).</p>
                <image source="images/tech-72.png" width="60%"><description>This image shows a screenshot of a word document works cited. Three citations are listed, each in a new paragraph, but with no indentations.</description></image>
            <p>Next, place your cursor at the very beginning of the second line of your citation, right-click, and select the <q>Paragraph</q> option.</p>
                <image source="images/tech-73.png" width="60%"><description>This screenshot is the same document shown in the previous image. The cursor has right-clicked at the second line of the first paragraph. In the right-click menu, the option reading "paragraph" is selected.</description></image>
            <p>In the <q>Indentations</q> category, change the <q>Special:</q> option to <q>Hanging.</q> When you do this, the <q>By:</q> should automatically change to 0.5" (and if it doesn't, increase it to 0.5"). Click <q>OK</q><nbsp/><ellipsis/></p>
                <image source="images/tech-74.png" width="60%"><description>This is a screenshot of the "paragraph" menu options. The second section of the menu is titled "Indentation." On the right-hand of this section, next to "Special," the option "Hanging" is selected in the drop-down menu.</description></image>
            <p><ellipsis/><nbsp/>and your source magically scoots over half an inch, creating a hanging indent!!</p>
                <image source="images/tech-75.png" width="60%"><description>This image shows the same word document screenshotted in the first image in this section. Now, all of the sources have "hanging" indentations: the first line is not indented, but the second line and any subsequent lines are indented.
</description></image>
            <p>But what's really nice about this feature is that you only need to set a hanging indent for the first citation; all subsequent citations will automatically indent over to mirror the hanging indent of Source A.</p>
            <p>LIFE=CHANGED.</p>

            <title>Peer Editing Tools</title>
            <p>One of the cooler features of word processors is that many of them allow you to comment, offer suggestions, and even directly overlay changes onto a document. This can be particularly useful when you are peer reviewing another person's document, which you will undoubtedly be doing a lot of throughout your college career. Keep in mind that it's generally more constructive to use the comment function to offer suggestions rather than editing the document directly. That said, tracking changes directly can be useful for smaller errors or editing suggestions. (For more tips on peer review etiquette, see <xref ref="peer-review"/>.)</p>
                <image source="images/tech-17.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows a screenshot of a word document. The document has the text, "This is a great sentence, filled with intelligent observations and sharp analytical poise; in fact, this is such a great sentence that I doubt any edits will be needed at all."</description></image>
            <p>To comment on a specific part of someone's writing, open the <q>Review</q> tab, highlight the desired phrase, and select <q>New Comment</q> in the toolbar.</p>
                <image source="images/tech-18.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows the same document as the previous image. The word "great" is highlighted (the first time it appears), and the toolbar is on the "Review" menu. The option "New comment," on the far left of the toolbar menu, is emphasized with a red box around it and an arrow pointing to it.</description></image>
            <p>A red-outlined box will appear to the right with a line indicating the section being discussed by the comment. In this box, you can write friendly suggestions, observations, and questions about the text, which your peer may then reply to or check off as resolved.</p>
                <image source="images/tech-19.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows the same document previously shown, but the word "great" is highlighted in red (the first time it appears) and the following comment has been added in the right margin: "Consider using stronger word choice here." </description></image>
            <p>You can also edit the other's person's writing directly using Track Changes. Open the <q>Review</q> tab, select <q>Track Changes</q> in the toolbar, and scroll down to select the <q>Track Changes</q> option.</p>
                <image source="images/tech-20.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows the same document. An additional comment has been added on the phrase "this is such a great sentence" and reads "Slightly repetitive, consider mixing it up." In the "Review" toolbar, the "Track changes" option has been turned on. It is emphasized with a red box around it and a red arrow pointing to it.</description></image>
            <p>When using Track Changes, feel free to edit the document as you would any other (deleting portions, adding new ones, <etc/>) and all of the changes you make will be in red overlaid on top of the original document. Track Changes is useful because it allows you to work directly with the text while saving the original. However, try to keep the revisions you make using Track Changes to a minimum while reviewing peers' work; if you change, add, or remove too much from the text, you could inadvertently start to take control of the document, making it less of a mutual collaboration between you and your peer and more of a copy editing session.</p>
            <sbsgroup>
                    <image source="images/tech-21.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows the same document, but at the end of the sentence "at all" has been replaced with "to improve it." Because track changes are on, "to improve it" appears in red and underlined in red. In the right margin, a note reads "Deleted: at all."</description></image>
            </sbsgroup>
            <p>If you are being reviewed, you can accept or reject tracked changes by placing your cursor over a particular change and clicking <q>Accept Change</q> or <q>Reject Change,</q> which will replace the original work with the edit or ignore the change altogether, respectively.</p>
                    <image source="images/tech-23.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows the same document, with the cursor over the "Accept" option in the "Review" toolbar, which is accompanied by an image of a sheet of paper with a green check mark. A drop-down menu is available, and the option "Accept and move to next" is selected. </description></image>
                    <image source="images/tech-24.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows the same document, with the cursor over the "Reject" option in the Review" toolbar, which is accompanied by an image of a sheet of paper with a red X-mark. A drop-down menu is available, and the option "Reject and move to next" is selected.</description></image>
            <p>After reviewing your peer's comments and tracked changes, your sentences (and those of your peer) will likely be even stronger than before.</p>
                <image source="images/tech-25.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows the same document with the sentence revised according to the feedback from the previous images. It now reads, "This is a magnificent sentence, filled with intelligent observations and sharp analytical poise; in fact, this is so strong I doubt any edits will be needed at all."</description></image>

            <title>Adding a Cover Page</title>
            <p>Sometimes your professors will require you to preface your paper with a cover page. Cover page formats vary by citation style, but typically include the title of your paper, your name, course number/title, professor name, and assignment due date. The APA style requires university affiliation, a running header, and an author note instead of course, professor name, and due date. Remember that if you have any questions about how to format your cover page, it's best to ask your professor for their preferences.</p>
            <paragraphs>
                <title><init>APA</init></title>
                <p><init>APA</init>-style cover pages require your title, name, university affiliation, an author note, a page number, and a header that runs along the top of every page of the document. Generally this running header provides a short synopsis of the topic of your paper (but does not exactly copy your title).</p>
                <p>To begin, place your double-spaced title, name, and university affiliation about one-third of the way down the page. If an author's note is required, place this about two-thirds of the way down (and centered). An author's note includes the departmental and institutional information of the student, any grants or funding associated with the project, and contact information by which to contact them.</p>
                    <image source="images/tech-32.png" width="60%"><description>This image shows a screenshot of a word document APA cover page. All text is centered and double spaced. About one-third of the way down the page is the title, the following text "A Fascinating Title: Ensuring Maximum Attention-Grabbing from Your Reader." After one blank line is the author’s name: "Bethany Llewellyn [line break] Author’s Note." Two thirds of the way down the page is the text "[Author Note]."</description></image>
                <p>To add the page number and running header, select the <q>Insert</q> tab, click <q>Page Number,</q> <q>Top of Page,</q> and <q>Plain Number 3.</q></p>
                    <image source="images/tech-33.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows the same word document as above, duplicated in two panels on the left and right. In the left panel, the "Insert" toolbar at the top of the page is open and "Page Number" is selected, which is indicated by a graphic of a piece of paper with a number sign on it. A drop down menu is open and the option "Page Number" is highlighted. In the right hand panel, "Page Number" has been selected and a pop-up window is visible. The option "Top of page (header)" is selected, and the "Alignment" option shows "Right."</description></image>
                <p>Next, you can add your running header in front of the page number by writing <q>Running head: TITLE.</q> To right-justify your running header, hit the <q>tab</q> key once. Keep in mind that your running header should not be more than 50 characters long.</p>

It reads "Running head: SUMMARY OF TOPIC," identical to the first page, but the cursor is placed before the "S" in "SUMMARY." The right-hand page is identical, but "Running head" has been removed from the header on the second page. It remains on the first page.</description></image>

                <p>For a Chicago-style cover page, your title, name, course name and number, and assignment due date are single-spaced. You do not need to add your professor's name (although doing so likely would not hurt). Your title is centered one-third of the way down the page; if it has a subtitle, separate it with a colon and place the subtitle on the next line. Your name, course name/number, and due date should all go about two-thirds of the way down and should be single-spaced.</p>

            <title>Finding and Replacing</title>
            <p>This is an essential tool to know how to use when you are writing, editing, and revising drafts. For instance, you might use the term <q>third world</q> repeatedly throughout your essay but then realize that <q>Global South</q> is a more appropriate option. Finding and replacing makes it easy for you to search for all instances of <q>third world</q> and replace them with <q>Global South.</q></p>

                <p>Here we replaced all <q>IMPORTANT WORD</q>s with <q>CRITICAL WORD</q>s, but keep in mind that it's often better to use a mix of important AND critical words to enhance your vocab diversity.

        <title>Zotero</title>
        <p>Now that you know how to make citations, we're going to let you in on a little secret: There's a magical program called Zotero that can do most of the citation grunt work for you. To call it <em>magic</em> is not to mislead; Zotero is the Muggle equivalent of the Sorting Hat. It somehow reads the minds of articles, books, and websites and knows which pieces of information go where<mdash/><em>it can literally cite all of your sources for you</em>.<nbsp/><ellipsis/> Just let that sink in for a minute.</p>
        <p><em>However</em>, since citation generators aren't (yet) perfect, it's still important that you understand how different styles format citations for different types of sources. Moreover, creating citations by hand is a rite of passage of sorts<mdash/>one you need to experience in order to appreciate the magic of Zotero. After weeks, months, or years of spending hours working on perfectly formatting a bibliography, the first time you use Zotero will be an experience like no other. You will exclaim and cry tears of joy as all of your citations instantaneously appear before you.</p>
        <p>In short, you need to do your own citations for awhile so you understand how they work and how to do them, but, once you're comfortable writing them by hand, you can delegate most of your citation work to a program like Zotero. You just need to be thorough in your quality control: You have to scan through each citation to make sure that Zotero read all of the right information and sorted it correctly.</p>
        <note>
            <!-- <title>Note</title> -->
            <p>Zotero (and other tools like it) can do many, many things. We're going to cover some basic capabilities Zotero has, but, to learn more about Zotero or other programs, visit the library's page, make an appointment with a <custom item="librarian"/>, or look up some YouTube tutorials.</p>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Step 3: Tell Zotero which sources you want it to save</title>
            <p>This will look a little different depending on what browser you're using; here's an example:</p>
                <image source="images/Zotero_01_edited.png" width="100%">
                    <description>This image is a screenshot of an information page for a scholarly journal article open in an online academic library database. The article is called "Trophic cascades in a formerly cod-dominated ecosystem." Immediately to the left of the URL at the top of the page is a small symbol showing pages of paper, with a red box around it and a red arrow pointing to it.</description>
            </image>
            <p>The sources will then appear in your Zotero library! You can put them in folders to stay organized.</p>
                <image source="images/Zotero_02_edited.png" width="100%"><description>This image is a screenshot of an open Zotero library. A bar on the left side of the screen shows different folders. The middle pane shows the contents of one folder, including several articles. The last article, highlighted in blue, is the same article that was open in the previous image.</description></image>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
            <title>Step 4: Cite some sources</title>
            <p>Go into your word processor of choice and start writing! You should notice a new tab along the top ribbon titled <quote>Zotero</quote>. When it comes time to cite your source, click on the <quote>Zotero</quote> tab and select <q>Add/Edit Citation</q>.</p>
                <image source="images/Zotero_03_edited.png" width="100%"><description>This image is a screenshot of a word document, with the toolbar tab that reads "Zotero" open. A red arrow and red box point out the option "Add/Edit Citation," which is indicated by a symbol of a piece of paper with "[-]" on it in red and a red "Z" next to it.</description></image>
            <p>You'll have to select what style of citation you want:</p>
                <image source="images/Zotero_04_unedited.png" width="60%"><description>This image shows a pop-up window with the title "Zotero - Document Preferences." A box at the top of the window is titled "Citation Style" and has a number of options listed; "Modern Language Association 8th edition" is selected in blue.</description></image>
            <p>And then search for the source you want to cite!</p>
                <image source="images/Zotero_05_unedited.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows a screenshot of a Zotero library. Over the top of the image is a large search bar with a red border and a red "Z" logo on the left.</description></image>
                <image source="images/Zotero_06_unedited.png" width="100%"><description>This image is identical to the previous image, but "Frank" has been typed into the search bar. A single search result is available below the search bar: the article "Trophic cascades in a formerly cod-dominated ecosystem" that was saved above, which has "Frank et al." listed as the author.</description></image>
                <image source="images/Zotero_07_unedited.png" width="100%"><description>This image is identical to the previous one, but the search result has been selected and the text "Frank et al." appears in a blue bubble in the search bar.</description></image>
            <p>There it is! A citation!</p>
                <image source="images/Zotero_08_unedited.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows the same word document shown above. However, the text "(Frank et al.)" has been inserted as a parenthetical citation. </description></image>
            <p>You can keep writing and citing as you go.</p>
                <image source="images/Zotero_09_unedited.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows the same word document with several additional parenthetical citations with different authors.</description></image>
            </paragraphs>
            <paragraphs>
            <title>Step 5: Make your bibliography</title>
            <p>Once you have all necessary sources saved in Zotero, you can ask it (nicely) to make your bibliography. Get ready to be amazed.</p>
            <p>In your document, go back to that <q>Zotero</q> tab and click <q>Add/Edit Bibliography</q>. This will generate a bibliography in your chosen style with all the sources you've sighted in your paper.</p>
                <image source="images/Zotero_10_edited.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows a blank page in a word document with the "Zotero" tab open in the menu at the top of the page. The menu option "Add/Edit Bibliography," which has an icon of two books with a red "Z" next to them,” is emphasized with a red box around it and a red arrow pointing to it.</description></image>
            <p>And there it is, just like that!</p>
                <image source="images/Zotero_11_unedited.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows the same word document with a formatted bibliography for several sources added.</description></image>
            <p>Magic! Still, Zotero can get things wrong, so always check over the bibliography. If anything is missing you can edit the metadata stored in Zotero.</p>

            <p>Adobe Reader is the most common free <init>PDF</init>-viewing software used for the reading, searching, printing, and notating of <init>PDF</init> files. Adobe is great because it allows you to easily interact with your sources, offering a variety of annotation capabilities; in this way, it's also more cost-efficient and environmentally friendly than printing out all 120 pages of that reading assignment because you can highlight and annotate most <init>PDF</init> types (although keep in mind your professor may like you to have a hard copy for class, anyways). To download Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, visit <url href="https://get.adobe.com/reader/">get.adobe.com/reader</url>.</p>

                    <image source="images/tech-80.png" width="100%"><description>This image is a screenshot of a scholarly journal article open in a web browser. A red arrow points to the "Download PDF" button in the upper right corner.</description></image>
            <p>If you have installed Adobe Acrobat Reader, your document should be automatically saved as an Adobe Acrobat <init>PDF</init> file. After it's saved, you can then open it, and it should open with Adobe Acrobat.</p>

        <paragraphs>
            <title>Step 4: Annotate to your heart's content</title>
            <p>There are several different ways to annotate a <init>PDF</init> document in Adobe Acrobat. We'll highlight some of these capabilities below.<dl>
                <li>
                    <title>Commenting</title>
                    <p>You can easily comment on certain parts of the source document by selecting the small speech bubble icon on the right side of the toolbar and clicking on the part you want to comment on. A small window text box will appear wherein you may leave notes/questions to yourself about the text, observations about how to use a certain piece of information, or reminders to do more research elsewhere. You can also engage in a dialogue with yourself (or others if you are collaboratively examining a source) by replying to these comments later on.</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-83.png" width="100%"><description>A screenshot of the same article above; the word "vagility" is highlighted in blue. A red arrow points to the comment button on the top toolbar, which is a small symbol like a speech bubble. </description></image>
                        <image source="images/tech-83_2.png" width="100%"><description> In the same article shown in the previous image, a comment has been added on the word "vagility." The comment is indicated by a small yellow square with a white symbol identical to the comment button. The comment is open in the margin and reads, "Vagility: ability to disperse/move from place to place."</description></image>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Highlighting</title>
                    <p>You can also easily highlight sections of the text using the highlighter function, making it easier for you to go back later and identify significant pieces of information. To do this, click on the highlighter icon on the far right of the toolbar (next to the comment icon) and select the section of the text you'd like to highlight (but try not to over-highlight!). See <xref ref="note-taking-strategies"/> for tips on how to annotate effectively).</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-84.png" width="100%"><description>A screenshot of the same article open in Adobe Acrobat; the highlight button in the upper toolbar, which is a symbol of a highlighter, is emphasized with a red box and arrow. Several sentences of text near the end of the page have been highlighted in yellow. </description></image>

            </dl></p>
        </paragraphs>
        <note>
            <title>Highlighting</title>
            <p>While this highlighting technique works for most <init>PDF</init> files, some files that have been photocopied don't have the right line-spacing to accommodate the highlighter function. However, Adobe is smart; in these cases, an option to highlight manually using a box-select tool should be available.</p>
        </note>
        <paragraphs>
            <title>Unlocking More Annotation Tools</title>
            <p>To unlock a host of other annotation functions, select the <q>Tools</q> tab at the top left of the screen; a screen of icons will appear. Select the <q>Comment</q> option at the top left of the screen.</p>
                <image source="images/tech-85.png" width="100%"><description>In a screenshot of an open Adobe Acrobat window, a red box is around the "Tools" option to the left of the top toolbar. The tools menu is open, with small pastel icons indicating more than a dozen tool options. The "comment" tool, again indicated by a small yellow symbol like a speech bubble, is boxed in red and emphasized by a small red arrow.</description></image>
            <p>The source document will reappear with a new toolbar below the original. Here you'll notice the commenting and highlighting icons along with a slew of other editing features.</p>
                <image source="images/tech-86.png" width="100%"><description>In this screenshot, the same journal article as above is open in Adobe Acrobat, but an additional toolbar featuring various icons has been added and is outlined in red.</description></image>
            <p>These features include the following:<dl>
                <li>
                    <title>Underlining</title>
                    <p>To underline a section of text, select the third icon from the left (<q>T</q> with a line underneath) and highlight the section of text you want underlined. A green line will appear beneath the section of text.</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-86_2.png" width="100%"><description>In this screenshot the underline option in the new toolbar, which is indicated by a capital "t" that is underlined, has a red box around it and is indicated by a red arrow. In the text of the article, several sentences have been underlined in green and a second red arrow points to them.</description></image>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Strike-Through</title>
                    <p>If you'd like to strike-through a section of text (particularly useful if you're editing one of your own pieces or if you want to identify a part of the source document with which you do not agree), select the icon fourth from the left (<q>T</q> with a strike-through) and highlight the desired section of text. A red line will strike through this section of text.</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-87.png" width="100%"><description>In this screenshot the strikethrough button, immediately to the right of the underline button and indicated by a capital "t" with a line through it, has a red box around it and an arrow pointing to it.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <title>Replacing Text</title>
                    <p>If you'd like to replace text (not so useful for annotating published source documents, but especially useful if you're editing yours or another's paper), select the fifth icon from the left (<q>T</q> with a strike-through and a speech bubble) and highlight the section of desired text. A blue line will strike through this section of the original text and a window text box will appear allowing you to write the text you want to replace it with.</p>

                    <p>If you'd like to insert text (again, more useful for documents you are actively editing than source documents you are annotating), select the sixth icon from the left (<q>T</q> with a subscript carrot) and place your cursor in the place in the text where you'd like to insert new text. A small blue box with a carrot will appear in the text, while a window text box will allow you to write the text you'd like to insert.</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-89.png" width="100%"><description>This image is a screenshot of the same PDF document shown above open in Adobe Acrobat. The insert button in the toolbar, indicated by a T with a subscript carrot next to it, is outlined in red and has a red arrow pointing to it. In the text, a small blue box with a carrot in it also has a red arrow pointing to it. In a column to the right of the page, a symbol that looks like the insert button is followed by the inserted text, which reads "Leopards are also a spiritually important and iconic charismatic megafauna species."</description></image>

                    <title>Adding Text Directly</title>
                    <p>If you'd like to add text directly onto the document (useful if you want to more easily view your comments), select the seventh icon from the left (plain <q>T</q>) and highlight the area you'd like the text to go. Begin writing and your comment will appear directly onto the document.</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-90.png" width="100%"><description>In this screenshot of the same PDF document, the add text directly button, which is simply a capital "t," has a red square around it and a red arrow pointing to it. In the article, next to the word "introduction," the text "Cite this section" has been added in a different font and is outlined in red.</description></image>

                    <title>Adding a Text Box</title>
                    <p>Another way to add text directly onto a source document is to create a text box. To do this, select the eighth icon from the left (<q>T</q> within a box) and create the text box where you want it on the document. A red text box will appear in which you can write your comment.</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-91.png" width="100%"><description>In this screenshot the add a text box button, which is an icon of a capital "t" in a small box, has a red box around it and a red arrow pointing to it. In the margin of the document, a red text box has been added and contains the following text: "Use these keywords for new search."</description></image>

                <li>
                    <title>Drawing Free-form</title>
                    <p>You can also draw free-form on the document to emphasize certain sections or (if you're good at drawing using a mouse or touchpad, which I am not) even draw pictures or write comments to annotate the document. To do this, select the ninth icon from the left (pen) and begin to write/draw in red pen anywhere on the document.</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-92.png" width="100%"><description>In this screenshot the free-form drawing button, which is an icon of a red pencil, has a red box around it and a red arrow pointing to it. In the text of the article, the keywords "conductance" and "occupancy modelling" are outlined in red free-form lines. The words "multi-data" and "low connectivity" in the introduction are also underlined with free-form red lines. </description></image>
                    <p>(Like I said, I'm not that artistically savvy.)</p>

                    <title>Erasing</title>
                    <p>If you'd like to erase something you've drawn, you can also do this by selecting the tenth icon from the left (eraser) and moving it over your drawing to erase it.</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-93.png" width="100%"><description>The erase button, which is a small black and white eraser, is in a red box and indicated by a red arrow. In the text, part of the free-form lines added in the previous image have been erased and are indicated by a red arrow.</description></image>

                    <title>Adding Shapes</title>
                    <p>If you're more artistically/visually inclined, you can also add pre-formed shapes to your document to draw emphasis to certain sections or have fun while you annotate. To do this, select the thirteenth icon from the left on the toolbar (cluster of shapes), and use the drop-down menu to select which shape you'd like to draw.</p>
                            <image source="images/tech-94.png" width="100%"><description>In a screenshot of the same PDF shown above, the toolbar button to add shapes is indicated by a red arrow. A drop-down menu is open below it, showing the following shape options with names and small outlines of the shapes: line, arrow, rectangle, oval, text callout, polygon, cloud, connected lines.</description></image>
                            <image source="images/tech-95.png" width="100%"><description>In this screenshot, red outlines of a cloud shape and a trapezoid shape have been added and a red arrow points to them.</description></image>
                    <p>You can also change the color, opacity, and line thickness of your drawing tools by selecting paint bucket and line-thickness icons at the far right of the toolbar.</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-96.png" width="100%"><description>In this screenshot, a blue circle in the toolbar has an open drop-down menu with a palette of colors and dark blue selected with a small check mark.</description></image>
                        <image source="images/tech-96_2.png" width="100%"><description>In this screenshot, the previously shown cloud shape is now outlined in line green and filled with dark blue.</description></image>
                    <p>Go wild! (But not too wild.)</p>

                    <title>Keeping Track of Your Comments</title>
                    <p>Adobe is also really great because it keeps track of each of your comments as you add them and provides a running list of them along the right side of the screen. If you want to jump to a certain comment, simply click on the desired comment in the list and the document will take you to that comment. You can also arrange these comments by page, author, date, type, checkmark status, and color or filter them by reviewer, type, status, and color.</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-97.png" width="100%"><description>This image shows a screenshot of the same PDF used throughout this section, open in Adobe Acrobat. A bar on the right side of the screen is outlined in red. It shows every modification that has been made to the document, with the name of the user who made the change, time of the change, and icon indicating the type of change. Text of comments or replaced text is also present in this bar. </description></image>

                    <title>Changing the Page Viewer</title>
                    <p>There are also useful page-viewing capabilities to the left side of the screen under the <q>Page Thumbnails,</q> <q>Bookmarks,</q> and <q>Attachments</q> icons. <q>Page Thumbnails</q> will allow you to see which page of the document you are currently viewing:</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-98.png" width="100%"><description>This is a screenshot of the same PDF document. On the left side of the page, a bar is open with small images of each page in the document. A small title that reads "Page Thumbnails" at the top of this bar has a red arrow pointing to it. To the left of the title, a small logo showing two pieces of paper is highlighted in blue.</description></image>
                    <p>Or you can switch to <q>Bookmarks</q> to view an outline of the source document and click to go to a certain section:</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-99.png" width="100%"><description>In this screenshot, the bar on the left instead shows an outline of the document. On the far left, a small logo of a paper clip is highlighted in blue.</description></image>
                    <p>If there are attachments that were included in the source document, selecting the <q>Attachments</q> option will allow you to view them.</p>

                    <title>Searching the Document Source</title>
                    <p>Finally, you can search for key words and phrases in the document by selecting the <q>Find text</q> icon (magnifying glass) in the upper left of the original toolbar. A window will appear in which you can type in the word or phrase you'd like to find; selecting <q>previous</q> or <q>next</q> will bring you to each instance in the document where that term was used.</p>
                        <image source="images/tech-100.png" width="100%"><description>In this screenshot of the same document, the magnifying glass in the top left of the window is in a red box and has a red arrow pointing to it. In the upper-right is a small pop-up window with the text "find" at the top and a white bar for typing text. Below the bar for text are two gray buttons that read "previous" and "next." </description></image>
